# NLP-LIVE-QA

## TODO

~~ 1. Michael -> create re-ranker using https://huggingface.co/amberoad/bert-multilingual-passage-reranking-msmarco ~~

~~2. Mason -> create BM25 retriever using https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/retriever~~

~~ 3. Kenneth -> create QA transformer using https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2 ~~


### Up For Grabs

~~* Chopper -> needs to take in document names and chop into appropriate sized string passages~~
* flask api -> would be nice to have a flask api to run this thing with. Probably want to treat rest of project as a project and import.
* testing script -> need to be able to automatically run a list of queries and time results.

## Random
I made a package structure so it would be super obvious who touches which packages. If you want to put your stuff on the root level, I don't care.
