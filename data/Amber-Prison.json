{"text": "Amber Prisons are Zhalfiran artifacts in which people can be locked away. They are guarded at the Amber Tombs of Aku . Amber Prisons are small, palm-size amber baubles. When opened, they begin to glow before sparking and snapping open with a sharp report followed by a short, sharp exhalation. The wizard Kaervek locked away Mangara in an Amber Prison and hid him in the Mwonvuli Jungle . After Scalebane's Elite and Asmira set Mangara free, Kaervek himself was locked in the Prison. The Amber Tombs were removed from the timeline by Teferi along with the rest of Aku and Zhalfir . In Zhalfir's own pocket plane , life progressed. A decade later, Kaervek's prison shattered, releasing him. The Wanderer was also temporarily caught in an Amber Prison."}
