{"text": "Leinore is a human from Innistrad , who was elected to be the Autumn Sovereign of the Harvesttide festival . Leinore's and her younger sister Sinnia 's mother was a werewolf. After Avacyn's unmaking, the Cursemute broke, causing their mother to leave their family to follow her baser instincts. When it came time to select the most recent season's Harvesttide Sovereign, Leinore was the obvious choice. Known for her love of all things festive and communal, one could easily identify an event hosted by Leinore by the abundance of food, drink, and somewhat excessive decorations. While she fully understands the festival's significance in restoring the balance between night and day, she refuses to let that dampen the mood. Her hard work instills both the witches and townsfolk with hope, and that hope inspires them all through the darkest night. During the preparations for the Festival, Leinore, and her younger sister Sinnia found a mask in the forest. Contrary to the wishes of her older sister, Sinnia wore the mask and ended up possessed by the powers of the witch Saryth . One night Leinore followed her sister into the forest and discovered along with Katilda that Saryth was using Sinnia to summon a creature called the Coiled One . The ritual was impeded by Leinore and Katilda, and they were able to save Sinnia. Although Leinore is of humble origins (she works in the fields) and the honorific is only temporary, her card has the creature type Noble ."}
