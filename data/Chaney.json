{"text": "Chaney was an archdruid during Modern Times on Aerona on Dominaria . By her own accord she was able to planeswalk but hadn't done so in many years. She healed Greensleeves' broken ankle and Gull 's knee. Chaney taught Greensleeves how to harness mana and planeswalking . During her training, Greensleeves found out that time in Chaney's house flew differently and what seems to be mere days, were indeed years. When Gull and the rest of the army finally found her, Greensleeves had grown up and become a much more skilled wizard. Chaney suffered a severe stroke, with half her body limp. In her dying moment, her life force was absorbed by Greensleeves. Three years later, Chaney returned as a shade , urging Greensleeves to make the \"final sacrifice\". After Greensleeves dons the Stone Brain and finds out that its ultimate secret is buried somewhere in the ruins of the College of Lat-Nam , Chaney's shade passes in the afterlife."}
