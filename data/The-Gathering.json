{"text": "The Gathering was the first summit of the Sages of Minorad , a group of wizards led by five native Dominarian planeswalkers who gathered in the spires of Minorad - the northernmost habitable point on the continent of Corondor - to share their knowledge and document the passing of time. This took place in 3000 AR , which became year 1 of the Reckoning of the Sages of Minorad ."}
