{"text": "Heidar was a Dominarian cryomaster who lived at the time of the Thaw . As the leader of the Cult of Rimewind , he styled himself Master of Rimewind Keep , Chosen of the Blessed Cold, and Savior of the Boreal lands. With his Rimewind magic he tried to undo the World Spell and plunge Dominaria into a new Ice Age . As a child, Heidar was found out in the cold by his predecessor Gendrin . Gendrin recognized his inherent understanding of ice, frost, and chill winds, and also his natural talent and raw power. . As Heidar grew in maturity and power, he was initiated into the Rimewind doctrine. First as an acolyte, and later as a task mage. When he and Lindra , the daughter of Gendrin and his love, first experienced the encroaching warmth of the south, he was terrified. He heard about the World Spell from the refugees who began to arrive, and of the plagues that ravished the south with no cold to keep them in check. Arguing with Gendrin about the need to stop the Thaw, Heidar accidentally killed the old man. He didn't hesitate to take over his role as Master of Rimewind. Struck by fear of the Thaw, Heidar sent investigators to scour the continent for anything that could help them fight back. He and his scouts discovered the Phyrexians buried in the ice of Ronom Glacier . Thanks to a temporary alliance with Haakon , the zombie leader of the Order of Stromgald , Heidar's scholars found the incantations needed to awaken the Phyrexians in the knowledge vaults of Lim-D\u00fbl at Tresserhorn . It took Heidar another dark alliance to attain the elementalism needed to reawaken the Phyrexians. He allied with Garza Zol , the powerful vampire queen of the plague-wracked city of Krov , to gain access to her Krovikan elementalists. In return, Heidar helped Garza Zol crush the alliance between the Balduvians , the Kjeldorans and the Yavimayans in the southeast of Terisiare. The Cult of Rimewind succeeded in their plans and reanimated many Phyrexian war-beasts with magic-infused ice crystals . When a Balduvian force under Lovisa Coldeyes stormed Rimewind, Heidar activated the Phyrexians, turning the battle into a massacre. When she refused to surrender, Lovisa was executed by Heidar. The beasts went on a rampage across the frozen north, slaughtering everything in their path. Kjeldor retaliated, but the knights of Stromgald kept them in check. Driven mad under the influence of Phyrexian magic, Heidar began attacking his enemies and allies indiscriminately, even killing Lindra. Garza Zol, now aware of the danger posed by Heidar and his machines, ordered assassins planted in Rimewind to kill the mad wizard. Without Heidar's guidance, the Phyrexians ran amok and were easily destroyed by shamans from Yavimaya who arrived at Kjeldor's bidding. The forces of Kjeldor and Yavimaya proceeded to rout the leaderless Rimewind cultists and a Yavimayan ritual permanently ended Rimewind's unnatural winter and restored the Thaw to its proper course.
