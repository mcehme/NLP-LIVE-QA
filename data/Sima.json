Sima and Jodah met while traveling to the City of Shadows , and she helped him free Lord Ith . They married and settled down in the City of Shadows. Sima's death was the latest in a long line of emotional strains for Jodah, who began to descend into madness. He saved himself by using his mirror to save his memories, wipe his mind clean, and use the memories in the mirror to regain himself, without the emotional attachment."}
