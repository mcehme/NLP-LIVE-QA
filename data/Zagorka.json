{"text": "Zagorka was a human woman living on Otaria , Dominaria , who came into conflict with Ixidor and Kamahl . Zagorka sought employment in Cabal City with her mule Chester . This led her to the war against the wizard Ixidor where she and other refugees found asylum in an abandoned city they called Sanctum . She quickly became their leader and as the city grew its mysteries started to unveil: the city was in fact the Numena Averru , who considered Zagorka as his mother. In the final battle between Akroma and Phage , Kamahl killed them both and (accidentally) Zagorka as well, which led to the creation of Karona ."}
