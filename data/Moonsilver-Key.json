{"text": "The Moonsilver Key is an artifact from Innistrad . The Moonsilver Key is a sacred vessel, instrumental in the ritual at the Harvesttide festival to stop the Eternal night . It unlocks the lock of bright gold in the center of the Celestus . It was taken from the Dawnheart Coven centuries ago. The Moonsilver Key looks like an offering bowl. The Sungold lock is much the same; together, the two form a sphere. Planning to use the Celestus to reverse the Eternal night , Katilda recruited Arlinn Kord and the Gatewatch to find the Moonsilver Key. Believing the Church of Avacyn might have stolen the key, Arlinn, Teferi , Kaya , Chandra Nalaar and the cathar Adeline started their investigation in Thraben . In Thraben, the group discovered a clue in a book found by Kaya. The Key had been given by a witch to the Betzold family, long ago. In the ruins of the city they encounter Bishop Worrin Betzold , who became a zombie during the events of The Travails. Arlinn interrogates the bishop and can only get one name, Dennick . The group decides to go to Gavony where the Betzold family had a mansion. In the ruins of the mansion they find the spirit of the bishop's son, Dennick Betzold , who tells that the Key was given by his great-grandfather to Sorin Markov , so that the vampire could protect the artifact . At the Manor Markov, Teferi and Arlinn argue to Sorin about the Key's importance in restoring balance to Innistrad, but Sorin doesn't mind and refuses to hand over the artifact. When Arlinn mentions Avacyn , the enraged vampire attacks her twice with his sword. In the second attack Sigarda appears (in answer to a prayer made by Arlinn and his group before entering the Manor) and stops the attack. The angel says that the Key is in Sorin's quarters, and that she will stop the vampire to give the group a chance to reach the artifact. In Sorin's quarters they find the Key over a statue of Avacyn (beheaded by Sorin). The statue is under a painting of Sorin with his grandfather Edgar Markov . Returning to the Celestus, they arrived just as Tovolar 's howlpack started their attack on the festival. While the others organized the defense, Kaya delivered the Key to Katilda . The witches begin the ritual and after the battle Chandra Nalaar and Adeline take Arlinn to the center of Celestus. Katilda asks Arlinn to help complete the ritual. After Arlinn offers her blood, Katilda offers her soul that goes into the Key. But, Olivia Voldaren appeared and interrupted the ritual by taking the Key with her. After ruining the ritual, Olivia left with the Key that contained Katilda's soul. She intended to use Sigarda 's blood and the Key's powers to control Innistrad's angels . For that, she would need the powers of Edgar Markov . Sorin tried to block the marriage between Olivia and is grandfather by attacking Olivia at the altar. His attack ended up awakening Katilda's spirit , who was inside the Key. Katilda manifested by coming out of the Key in the form of a spirit, and used her powers to free Sigarda (who had been captured and imprisoned by Olivia). With Sorin Markov 's assistance, Arlinn and the Gatewatch managed to recover the Key. They hastened their return to the Celestus to complete the ritual. When the Moonsilver Key and the Sungold Lock were joined, a flash of light flooded the Celestus. It was warm as sunlight, and the Celestus roared to life, shaking off centuries of overgrowth. With each passing of the arms, the light increased in intensity. Eventually only a single column remained, running from the Celestus to the moon itself. When the light faded, already begun her descent. The balance between night and day was restored. After the balance between night and day was restored, Katilda allowed Teferi to borrow the key for his temporal studies, and his fight against the Phyrexians . The Key is one of the components of the Temporal Anchor developed by Saheeli Rai , helping to project Teferi's \"spirit\" into the past during the events of the Brothers' War .
