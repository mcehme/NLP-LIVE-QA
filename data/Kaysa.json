Kaysa was the ward of the town church and assistant to Halvor. When Kaysa was ten, the Elder Druid Kolbjorn discovered that she had the crescent Mark of the Elder Druid and took her in to raise her as his child with his partner Disa . As a young druid, she helped Freyalise cast the World Spell to end the Ice Age. She became an Elder Druid of the Juniper Order at the close of the Ice Age . She married the knight Jaeuhl Carthalion after Freyalise introduced them. They led the Fyndhorn survivors with Laina , Taaveti , Jaya Ballard , and the knights of Kjeldor to Yavimaya as sea levels rose. When the Heart of Yavimaya awoke after the World Spell and used its vines to kill sapient gorillas , elves , and humans , Kaysa was kidnapped by a gorilla shaman. However, she convinced a gorilla chieftain to ally his people with the elves, and attack the Heart of Yavimaya , cleansing the forest. Jaya then helped deliver her child . Quoted or referred to:"}
