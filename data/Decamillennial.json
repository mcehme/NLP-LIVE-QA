{"text": "The Decamillennial was the ten-thousand year anniversary of the signing of the Guildpact on the plane of Ravnica . On the day of the Decamillennial, the Selesnyan leaders (the Chorus of the Conclave ) would perform the convocation, a ritual through which the entire plane would become blessed, their sins forgiven. However, the vampire Szadek attacked the ceremony and, with the aid of his lupul and Savra , he almost destroyed the Guildpact, until Agrus Kos and others managed to arrest him (though this in itself broke the Guildpact)."}
