{"text": "Krosa is a forest region on the continent Otaria on Dominaria . It is located between Tamingazin and Pardia . Krosa is the primary location for the Odyssey and Onslaught blocks. Visions of Krosa. Art by John Avon , Rob Alexander , Tony Szczudlo , and D. Alexander Gregory Krosa is home to various species of large animals, as well as to centaur , nantuko and human druids . It is also famous for giant dragonflies and grendelkin . Krosa is unusual for a Dominarian forest , as it does not seem to feature any elves , which only live in the southern forests of the continent. Notable natives of Krosa included Seton , Stonebrow and Thriss ; Kamahl eventually took residence in it too. In the century following the Phyrexian Invasion of Dominaria , the forest\u2019s size and density significantly increased. Hunting dropped off due to the suddenly increased ferocity of Krosan wildlife, giant thorns began springing up in the middle of paths, trees moved to block travel, and nantuko presence in the forest increased. The once-friendly druids who inhabited the forest grew somber and suspicious, while Krosan centaurs, already an unfriendly people, became vigilant to the point of paranoia. Krosa was a frequent target of Cabal poachers, who would capture fierce animals from the forest and bring them back to the pits to fight as entertainment for the crowds. Its foundations were corrupted by the Cabal Patriarch . Later, the barbarian -turned-druid, Kamahl, resided there, and it was he who planted the Mirari there thinking that without a wielder the artifact would be harmless. However, its power soaked into the entire continent and mutated the inhabitants, especially those within the forest, transforming many of the beasts into enormous monsters. This caused the animals of the forest to go mad, wildly attacking anyone that entered the forest and even leading the forest to attack surrounding farmsteads and villages. Following Karona 's apocalypse and the subsequent weakening of mana throughout Dominaria , Krosa's trees decayed, leaving the forest a shadow of its former grandeur. The druids remained, however, dedicating themselves to the memory of Kamahl and restoring the forest's greatness. These druids included Zyd and Baru . Associated cards: Referred to:"}
