{"text": "Towser was an egoistic wizard interested in astronomy and astrology, living on Aerona ( Dominaria ). He was the main foe of Greensleeves and Gull . He hired Gull as a member of his traveling crew to tend his livestock and wagons. After he had gathered a group of wizards who were once defeated by Greensleeves, he forced her via the Stone Brain to be obedient and planned to kill her. After Greensleeves defeated him yet again she found a terrifying punishment for Towser. With the Coral Helm she took away his gift of doing magic. Tower used all colors of magic except white: blue ( Unsummon , Mahamoti Djinn ), green ( Regeneration , Wall of Brambles ), red ( hydra , berserkers ) and black ( Pestilence )."}
