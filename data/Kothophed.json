{"text": "Kothophed was one of the four demons who dealt with Liliana Vess following the Mending . He bestowed upon Liliana eternal youth, carved into her skin as intricate tattoos. Kothophed appeared to have a tight hold on Liliana, and as part of her servitude towards him, she was sent to retrieve the Chain Veil from the Onakke Catacombs on Shandalar . Unwittingly, he had played right into the hands of a plot far grander than himself. When Liliana took possession of the Chain Veil, she was granted enough power to throw off the yoke he had placed upon her and she sought him out to finally end him. While dying, the demon pleaded to her that she did not know what she had taken upon herself and that killing him would not grant her what she sought. Unimpressed, Liliana finished the demon with the power of the Veil. Associated cards: Depicted in:"}
