{"text": "Amonkhet Booster Battle Packs Card comparisons Deck Builder's Toolkit Planeswalker decks Amonkhet is the 74th Magic expansion, and the first in the Amonkhet block . It was released on April 28, 2017, and is a large expansion . It is set on the plane of the same name . Amonkhet is a top-down -designed Magic set, meaning that it was designed and developed with flavor in mind first. The set is inspired by Ancient Egypt mixed with imagery referencing Nicol Bolas . Amonkhet contains 269 cards (20 basic lands, 101 commons, 80 uncommons, 53 rares, 15 mythic rares) and includes randomly inserted premium versions of all cards. The expansion symbol is a pyramid. The Planeswalker decks contain 10 additional cards that are considered to be part of the set (2 mythic planeswalkers, 2 rares, 2 uncommons, 2 commons and 2 common dual taplands ). These are numbered #270/269 to #279/269). The other 8 dual taplands appear in the Deck Builder's Toolkit (#280/269 to #287/269) Full-art basic lands appear in approximately one out of every four boosters and are available in other products as well. The set introduces punch cards with markers and counters to the game. The goal of this set was to try to create a sense of dissonance, of unease. R&D wanted the players to feel like the Gatewatch felt - that there's something wrong with this world that you can't quite put your finger on. To capture this, they made the mechanics feel one way while having the creative elements go another. The names and art tell you that this is a glorious world where the inhabitants are content, but the play is ruthless. Amonkhet is a plane ruled by Nicol Bolas . The desert oasis forges warriors . They train their entire life for a chance to face the Trials of the Five Gods and join the elite ranks of the Worthy and to claim an honored place in the Afterlife. They prepare for the great God-Pharaoh 's return. When The Gatewatch arrives to take out Bolas, they meet with fierce resistance in the desert , and in the city a society centered around death. The cards that represent the Story Spotlights in Amonkhet are: Renewed Faith , Cruel Reality , Anointed Procession , By Force , and Gideon's Intervention . Main article: Magic Story * This story was mistakenly published featuring an exchange between Chandra and Nissa that was revised to make its romantic nature more subtle. The original line was \"'So... friendship is about the limit of what you feel comfortable with right now?'\" The current version reads simply \"'So... friendship ?'\" Amonkhet is sold in 16-card boosters (one card being a marketing card ), two planeswalker decks , the Amonkhet bundle , Booster Battle Packs , the Deck Builder's Toolkit and a Land Station . An early announced spring Gift Box was apparently cancelled. The boosters feature artwork from Combat Celebrant , Battlefield Scavenger , Oketra the True , Honored Crop-Captain and Curator of Mysteries . The bundle now includes a token pack containing 25 double-sided tokens (including all embalmed tokens). The Masterpiece Series for Amonkhet block are called Amonkhet Invocations . These are all premium foil cards with a special Amonkhet card frame and a separate expansion symbol ( ). Thus, they are not part of the sets. Amonkhet Invocations are all about the Amonkhet gods, their magic and their servants. They include all new art, a card frame inspired by Egyptian steles without flavor text . They appear slightly more often than premium mythic rares. These cards are playable in limited and formats where they're already legal . There are 30 Invocation cards appearing with Amonkhet and 24 more cards appear in Hour of Devastation . Main article: Amonkhet Invocations Trials of the Gods Four-sided \"lazotep\" counter Magic Open House took place on April 15, 2017. It is an event-filled day where players can stop by their local store for fun, casual play that includes learn-to-play Magic events, free 2017 Welcome Decks for new players, and premium foil full-art lands for participating. Prerelease Events took place on April 22, 2017. Players were encouraged to complete the \"Five Trials of the Gods\". Players who attended Prerelease received a Trials Activity Card in their Prerelease pack. They were rewarded pyramid-shaped (four-sided) \"lazotep\" counters for each trial they completed. The counters could be used to keep track of -1/-1 counters on their cards. Release on Magic Online was Monday, April 24, 2017. This was even earlier than the paper release.

The bottom half of Amonkhet split cards is turned sideways for easy use out of the graveyard Amonkhet has a strong graveyard component. Unlike Shadows over Innistrad , this uses the graveyard mainly as a resource . Several cards in the set have abilities that care about you discarding other cards. They'll benefit you if an opponent makes you discard your cards, or if you discard them yourself. The set makes use of brick counters and -1/-1 counters . Amonkhet has three new named mechanics. Embalm \u2014 The embalm ability can only be activated if the creature is in the graveyard . When activated, the card is exiled and creates a token copy of itself. This creature token is a copy of the embalmed creature, except that it is a zombie in addition to its other creature types and monocolored white. Embalm appears most commonly in blue and white, with a green and red rare. Exert \u2014 When you declare an attacker with this ability, you make the decision whether to exert it. If you choose to exert, the creature gains a bonus. If you did, the creature won't untap as normal during your next untap phase. Exert appears in red, green and white. Aftermath \u2014 Split card halves with aftermath may only be cast from your graveyard. They are exiled after casting. While regular split cards were named with an \u201dA and B\u201c convention, Aftermath cards use an \u201dA to B\u201c convention. The set has one returning named mechanic: Cycling A black-red mini-theme, an unnamed mechanic R&D likes to call \" heckbent \", is a riff off of hellbent . Heckbent cares about you having one or fewer cards in your hand (as opposed to hellbent, which requires your hand to be empty). If you do, your creature gains an ability that makes either itself or others better. Another unnamed mechanic is nicknamed \" Ruthless \" (\u201cWhen ~ enters the battlefield, put ... -1/-1 counters on target creature you control.\u201d). It is featured in black and green , and is often paired with a second ability, often interacting with -1/-1 counters. Cartouche \u2014 An enchantment subtype exclusive to auras . Other cards interact with cartouches. Gods \u2014 Return from the Theros block . Curses \u2014 make a return, fittingly for an Egyptian themed block. Jackals \u2014 Reintroduced as a creature type . Zombies \u2014 Amonkhet features the first-ever monocolored white zombies. Some tokens created by the embalm mechanic feature the type line \" Human Zombie \", which is a first in Magic history. Similarly, Angel of Sanctions is the first zombie angel . Deserts \u2014 the first cards using the subtype since the original Desert appeared as timeshifted card in Time Spiral .
