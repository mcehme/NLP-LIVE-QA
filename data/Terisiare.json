{"text": "Terisiare was a large continent in the northern hemisphere of Dominaria , positioned in the middle of the ocean, halfway between Shiv and Aerona . Terisiare is the setting for the expansions Antiquities , The Dark , Ice Age , Alliances , and Coldsnap , as well as portions of the Urza's block and the novel The Thran . In the Modern Age it is sometimes referred to as the Lost Continent or as the Terisian Isles . The original continent surrounded by the Shielded Sea has been broken up into smaller islands. The Sea of Laments now lies in the middle of the old continent. To the west lie the Ilesemare Sea and the Endless Sea and Otaria , to the northeast, lie the Videnthian Sea and Greater Videnth , to the east lies the Visceral Sea , and to the south the Shielded Sea and the continent of Sarpadia . A population of dwarves have lived in Terisiare since prehistorical times, since before the Thran, at the very least, and possibly since before any human habitation in Terisiare. The earliest known humans to occupy Terisiare were the subjects of the cruel and powerful Primeval Dragons . These people overthrew their draconic masters and formed a huge empire based in Otaria . Many ancient storylines took place on Terisiare, including the Brothers' War . Throughout Dominarian history, several important nations were located on Terisiare, such as the Thran Empire , Argive , and Kjeldor . In the Ice Age that set in after the war, Terisiare was largely covered by glaciers; as they receded, the continent was ground up into a large archipelago. Almost all of the nations of Terisiare that have existed during the time of the Brothers' War, the Dark Age and the Ice Age have fallen: At the time of the Thran , five thousand years before the birth of Urza and Mishra , their Empire stretched across the entire continent. It was ultimately destroyed by Yawgmoth , ruler of Phyrexia . Halcyon , the capital. A beautiful city. At the time of The Brothers' War (0-64 AR ), 5,000 Years have passed since the Thran Civil War , and Terisiare has managed to largely rebuild into a dynamic and modernizing force on Dominaria . That is until the war came along. Almaaz , one of the most ancient kingdoms during the time of the Brothers. The only country that didn't collapse in the wake of the War. Sumifa , its capital The Halquina Mountains , the backbone of the southwestern peninsula. Argive , homeland of Urza and Mishra , the northernmost of the three coastal kingdoms.

After the Brothers' destruction, artifice and magic were treated with suspicion, fear, and hatred, and the Church of Tal sought to eradicate them.
