{"text": "The Scarlet Vizier was a war hero and the second in commmand to Lord Adam Carthalion in House Scarlet , one of the five powerful houses of Arathoxia on Dominaria . Secretly, he was Ravidel 's spellsquire . He had infiltrated House Scarlet for Ravidel to manipulate the lords of Carthalion , but at the same time hoping to use the Carthalion's power to kill Ravidel. During the summit of the Sages of Minorad , Ravidel attacked and forced its planeswalkers into his servitude under threat of reactivating the Golgothian Sylex . To honor his squire's loyalty, Ravidel gave Liana to the Vizier as a slave. Upon his master's return in 1280 Minorad Reckoning, the Vizier was one of the first to die during the siege of Arathoxia. Resurrected by Ravidel the next year, the Vizier only lived long enough for his master to learn that he had taken over Liana's mind and raped her during her enslavement, before he was killed again."}
