{"text": "Moonfolk is a blue creature type which originates in the Kamigawa block . The Moonfolk or Soratami (soh-rah-TAH-mee; Japanese: \u7a7a \u6c11 ; literally: \"Skyfolk\") are an enigmatic race of humanoid beings who are capable of flight and dwell in Kamigawa 's clouds. Physically, they are slim, possess blue-gray skin, and have long ears which they wrap over their heads. The Moonfolk claim to be descended from a moon Myojin . They live within floating palaces, of which their greatest structure on the clouds is a palace named Oboro . They watch over the world below, mostly indifferent to the concerns of the surface folk. They have a high emphasis on the study of magic and have some of the most learned mages on the plane. By the time of Neon Dynasty , the Moonfolk seem to have warmed slightly to the other mortal races of Kamigawa, opening their flying city of Otawara to outsiders (though still not Oboro palace itself). The Soratami make up a majority of the Saiba Futurists and have produced many of the plane's most revolutionary artificers . Whereas Westerners see a man's face on the moon, the Japanese see a rabbit \u2014 the tsuki-usagi, or moon-hare. The moonfolk were conceived by Japanese artist Ittoku, who introduced the subtle rabbit-like elements (white hair, long ears, and so on). The idea of the moonfolk came from a famous Japanese folktale about the mythical Lady Kaguya. The planeswalker Tamiyo is the only Moonfolk to have appeared outside of the Kamigawa block. In the original Kamigawa block, all Moonfolk were monoblue and had activations that required bouncing your lands."}
