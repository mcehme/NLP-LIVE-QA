{"text": "The Cauldron of Eternity is a magical artifact found on the plane of Eldraine . The Cauldron of Eternity is a huge stone bowl with metal legs, large enough to fit a human's body inside. Its interior has rocky, gem-like sides giving off a crystalline purple glamour. The Cauldron grants eternal youth and can return those who die to life if it deems them worthy. It used to be housed at Locthwain before it vanished, and many knights of that court have quested in the Wilds , sometimes for years at a time, to find it.

A voice that squeezed the heart called Garruk worthy . Associated cards: Depicted in: Referred to:"}
