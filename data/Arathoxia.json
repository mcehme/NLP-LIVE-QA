{"text": "Arathoxia (sometimes called ' Thoxia ) was a city-state of Dominarian Corondor at the delta of the Tenamis River on the southwestern coast of the land of Stonehaven . Arathoxia lay west of the Nyx swamp and the treacherous cliffs of Cape Casindral . Arathoxia used to be the world's richest city-state. It was reigned by a grand sultan.\nThere were five powerful houses: House Pearl (?) (or House Bikov ). Possibly based in Hamath . House Sapphire (or House Kavrel ). Based in Telemar City . House Jet (or House Khone ). Based in the Black Fortress in Arathoxia itself. House Ruby (also House Scarlet or House Carthalion ). Ruled by Lord Adam Carthalion, or by the Scarlet Vizier during his absence. Based in Castle Melmereth in Ephren . House Emerald (or Verdenth ). Ruled from the forest Krysalthus by Lady Verdenth . It was the city where Jared Carthalion grew up with Ezer . Ravidel ravaged the city using the Chaos Orb in the year 1280 by the Reckoning of the Sages of Minorad and captured the following winter, in early 1281. Even after its fall, amidst broken columns and shattered lives, there was both hope and resistance to the Battlemage. General Yorgo , one-time companion to Jared Carthalion, is desperately defending the city and its residents from the worst of the Planeswalker War ."}
