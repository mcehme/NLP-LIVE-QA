{"text": "Rayne of the Tolarian Academy on Dominaria was chancellor of the Tolarian Academy, the wife of Barrin , and mother of Hanna . She was killed by Greel during the Keldon invasion of Jamuraa . Rayne was brought to the Tolarian Academy as part of a small group of newly accepted scholars despite exceeding the usual age limit for admission. She immediately caught the attention of her future husband, Barrin. Rapidly rising through the ranks to a position as a tutor, she eventually gained an appointment to chancellor. At this level, she often performed as head of the academy while Urza or Barrin were both away and was known to oppose Urza's plans despite Barrin's steadfast support. Despite her husband's fears of possible casualty, Rayne felt obligated to participate in the Prophecy War after many of her students were sent to assist in battle. After leading several successful missions alongside Jolrael , she wandered from the group on horseback and was thrown off by a nearby explosion. Battered and broken, she was unable to defend herself against the mutant warrior Greel , who swiftly ended her life. Over three centuries after her death, associate professors at Tolaria West are known as \"Raynian\" Associate Professors. Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
