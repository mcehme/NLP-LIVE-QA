{"text": "Kami (KAH-mee; Japanese: \u795e ) are \"great spirits\", specifically the spirits (though not all are typed as such ) that associate with all things in the world of Kamigawa . Kami come in an overwhelming variety of forms, even among the same \"species\" of kami, and their brand of magic is mysterious and beyond anything mortals have conceived.  The greatest kami of all are the five myojin , rivaled only by the mighty O-Kagachi .  It was because the theft of O-Kagachi's scion, that the Kami War began. When the kami manifest into the ordinary world, their manifestation is a bit unstable and creates strange energy objects orbiting around them. When kami are killed, they dissolve into a fine mist. As they have no flesh to be compleated, they were killed en masse by the Phyrexians. About 1200 after the Kami War the kami are threatened by the growth of the modern city of Towashi. Many fled to the remains of the Jukai forest, and were hostile to humans. For this reason, Eiganjo trained many kami diplomats to try to keep the peace between the mortal and spirit realms. According to Brady Dommermuth \"[t]he overarching premise of the Kamigawa block is 'Shinto gone wrong.' In Shinto, a belief system indigenous to Japan, everything has a kami. Kami are gods of a sort; they\u2019re the eternal essences of things, people, places, ideas, and so on. To give Kamigawa its own distinct look, as well as to reflect the fact that the plane was in turmoil, we concepted the kami as bizarre creatures that look out of place in the natural world, as though they couldn\u2019t even realistically exist within it.\" Akuba (ah-KOO-bah). An evil, hag -like spirit-world creature. Baku (BAH-koo). A benevolent spirit with aspects of a lion and other animals that is said to eat the bad dreams of children. Bunrei (BOON-ray). A spirit created by dividing another spirit. Also, the ceremony of this act of division. Garami (gah-RAH-mee). Something that catches or snatches. Genju (GEN-joo). A great spirit of the land. Go-Shintai . Physical objects worshipped at or near Shinto shrines as repositories in which spirits or kami reside. Goryo (GOR-yo or GOHR-yoh ). The vengeful spirit of a mortal who died in anger or without the proper rites. Kaijin (KYE-jihn). A kami of water. Kirin . A mythical, otherworldly creature with aspects of a horse , a dragon , and a deer or goat . Before the war, kirin were omens of good fortune and long life. Kodama (koh-DAH-mah). A tree spirit.

In the last few years of the war, these flares took shape and intention. Zubera (ZOO-beh-rah). The faceless kami of a human who has been pulled into the spirit world. The Dragon Spirits are powerful kami of Kamigawa . There are five, one for each color of magic. Unlike most dragons , they have neither limbs nor wings. Instead, they are giant serpentine beings akin to wurms , however, they still maintain the ability to fly. During the Kami War , they did not side with O-Kagachi (who himself is considered a dragon, but this has no relevance in the plot), but remained true to their pledge to protect several important places of the mortals. Yosei ( ), the Morning Star protected Eiganjo . He was ripped-apart in the battle against O-Kagachi, but survived and helped the Eiganjoan refugees in the battle against the hordes of the Myojin of Infinite Rage. Keiga ( ), the Tide Star protected Minamo . She was killed by Hidetsugu and his yamabushi minions during their attack on the school. Kokusho ( ), the Evening Star was the guardian of the Takenuma swamp. Ryusei ( ), the Falling Star was the guardian of the Sokenzan mountains. Jugan ( ), the Rising Star protected the forest of Jukai . In the initial stages of the war, he was summoned by the monks of the Order of the Sacred Bell to fight in the Battle of Silk . He was killed but blessed the monks with power even after he was gone. During the final stages of the war he was summoned by Sosuke and Sachi to aid the Orochi against the Soratami invaders. Apparently he had the ability to come back from the dead (perhaps all kami can). More than 1200 years after the Kami War , the dragons have been reborn and continue to be the protectors of Kamigiwa.
