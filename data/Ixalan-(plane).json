{"text": "Ixalan (/\u026aks\u0259l\u0251\u02d0n/ IKS-uh-lahn ) is a Mesoamerican -inspired plane full of uncharted jungles where dangerous beasts, magnificent ruins, and lost treasures lie waiting to be discovered. In ancient times, multiple civilizations inhabited Ixalan's Core. Many were destroyed by outside forces, and others were unable to master the power of Cosmium . Only the Oltec civilization, the ancestors of the Sun Empire , survived. On this plane, the planeswalker Azor created a powerful artifact , known as the Immortal Sun , to trap the evil Nicol Bolas . For this reason, Planeswalkers could enter Ixalan, but until 4560 AR could not leave . The Immortal Sun was once guarded by holy custodians in a mountaintop monastery on the continent of Torrezon . Its presence gave the local monarch disproportionate influence in regional matters. The monastery fell under attack by the forces of the rival king Pedron the Wicked who stole the Immortal Sun but lost it to an unidentified winged being. Eight hundred years ago, the mountainous nation called Torrezon (it later gave its name to the whole continent) split into three parts when its monarch died, with each portion ruled by one of the monarch's children. A long religious war ensued. It raged on for three centuries, before the first vampire, Elenda of Garrano , ended it. After the unification, many of Torrezon's nobles undertook Elenda's transformative ritual, and it became known as the Rite of Redemption by the church. The United Legion of Dusk began a series of wars and eventually took over the whole continent. When the last city-states were conquered, its inhabitants took to the sea and formed the Brazen Coalition . On the continent of Ixalan , the River Heralds was once the dominant inhabitants of Ixalan with a large power of their own, and their strength was once enough to keep the Sun Empire out of the interior. The Sun Empire was first founded from Orazca by Chacanto Intli , who united the various city-states into a central empire. Following a devastating war with the River Heralds under Apatzec Intli I , who had gained possession of the Immortal Sun and used it without restraint, their civilization was reduced to a few coastal cities, with Orazca being lost to them. The empire still confronted the Heralds on its borders. The latest emperor, Apatzec Intli III asserted control and is expanding again. The Sun Empire recently was besieged by pirate raids by the Brazen Coalition and the advance of the Legion of Dusk which is seeking the Immortal Sun. All factions close in on the Lost City of Orazca , which is said to hide the ancient artifact. The Immortal Sun was found by several of the factions, but then was stolen and removed from the plane by a henchman of Bolas. The barrier was now broken and several planeswalkers left the plane. With Orazca retaken, the Sun Empire pushed the Legion of Dusk back to the sea, capturing and reverse-engineering their fleet in preparation for an invasion of Torrezon. Forests were felled to raise a new fleet, known as the Dawn Fleet. Hundreds of ships were built, and nearly ten thousand soldiers and sailors crewed them. The ships were launched to Torrezon, and their last known location was the midway point between the two empires. In 4562 AR , the plane mobilized against the growing New Phyrexian threat. Ixalan was a target in New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , seemingly invaded by the Alabaster, Copper and Furnace hosts. In the early days of the invasion, the sun was blocked out by smoke and falling ash from constant fires burning across the plane. After the elder dinosaur Etali was compleated, severe hurricanes began forming just off the coast of the continent of Ixalan. The skies flashed with red lightning, and the wind sparkled with razors, preventing aerosaurs from flying. A dozen towns along the northern barrier of the continent of Ixalan were wiped out, with a thousand reported dead. In the south of the Sun Empire, Atzocan, Otepec, and Little Pocatli suffered similar fates. The Sun Empire, pirates, and the Legion of Dusk banded together to fight the invaders, and Etali was finally felled by Zacama after injuring Zetalpa . In the aftermath of the Invasion, the plane's core was discovered underneath the cities of the Sun Empire. Ixalan's surface factions quickly moved to harness the newly-discovered resource cosmium . Map of the continent of Ixalan Ixalan is a hollow sphere. It has at least two large continents on its surface that are separated by the sea. Further north, travelers meet only unmelting ice. The Stormwreck Sea is the home to various archipelagos and numerous pirates . The floating city of High and Dry , the base of the Brazen Coalition The Burning Port , an ale house The Boatswain's Rear , another ale house The Spitfire Bastion , the base of Captain Vance on an island east of the Sun Coast \"Useless Island\" , where Jace Beleren was cast away following his defeat against Nicol Bolas .

It is home to large dinosaurs , that some of the natives managed to domesticate, and numerous secrets are hidden within the forests. The Sun Empire Sun Coast , the eastern coast. Pachatupa , its capital. Standing where the coastal plains rise into the high mountains. The river bordering Pachatupa feeds the city freshwater from vast inland mountain ranges, plunging down from Itlimoc through heavily irrigated floodplains. Tocatli , the emperor's palace at the heart of Pachatupa. During the Phyrexian Invasion, ash blanketed the citadel. The imperial throne room sits high atop the palace, but was converted to an imperial war room in preparation for the invasion of Torrezon. It is dominated by a scale map of Ixalan, Torrezon, and the Stormwreck Sea. The Temple of the Burning Sun Riverside districts Itlimoc state. A state with no cities, only holding small towns and maize, squash, and bean farms. Quetzatl state. A state with no cities, only holding small towns and maize, squash, and bean farms.

A lot of what inspires both the Sun Empire and the River Heralds comes directly from the Maya and Aztec and the succession of control from one to the other. Another source is the Lost world trope . Torrezon and Luneau themselves draw inspiration from colonial Spain and France, respectively.
