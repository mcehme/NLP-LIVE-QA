{"text": "Theros Card comparisons Event deck Intro packs Theros is the first set in the Theros block . It is the 62nd Magic expansion and was released on September 27, 2013. Theros is a large expansion . Theros contains 249 cards (20 basic lands, 101 commons, 60 uncommons, 53 rares, 15 mythic rares), and includes randomly inserted premium versions of all cards. The set has an ancient Greek themed top-down design, making use of many mythological tropes ( Heroes , Monsters , and Gods ). It is the first set to thematically take place on the plane of Theros . It is mostly monocolored with a handful of gold cards. Theros block is an enchantment block that plays off building blocks in M14 and Return to Ravnica block . The mood and tone are those of Greek myth: adventure, achievement, accomplishment, a hero's journey. Many existing creature types are reworked to match the Greek flavor. Apart from Minotaurs , it's not a tribal set. There are three Planeswalkers in the set, namely Elspeth and two new ones: Ashiok and Xenagos . There is an above average amount of legendary permanents. The expansion symbol depicts a stylized temple and altar. Main articles: Theros (plane) and Theros: Godsend, Part I Theros is watched over by a pantheon of 15 powerful gods . The gods, though residing in Nyx , are able to take on many forms and often walk among mortals. Each also has a unique color identity. The five core gods are mono-colored and make up the central pillars of the Therosian belief system. The color identities of these five are: Heliod (white), Thassa (blue), Erebos (black), Purphoros (red), and Nylea (green). The ten minor gods represent the two-colour pairings and were introduced later in Born of the Gods and Journey into Nyx . After planeswalking away from New Phyrexia , Elspeth finds herself on a vaguely familiar plane, Theros. While she had visited once years ago when she acquired her sword, she remains relatively unaware of the nature of the plane, namely the theology. The snake priests in a temple devoted to Pharika help her back to full strength while she reflects on her experiences with Koth , Venser , Tezzeret , Karn , and Melira back on New Phyrexia. More than anything Elspeth just wants a peaceful life like the one she had on Bant before the Conflux . However, on Theros the gods have different plans. Walking around the forests of Theros, Elspeth comes face to face with a deadly hydra having already killed many Therosian heroes. After a bitter battle she emerges the victor. Heliod, taking notice of her feat, now strives to make Elspeth his champion. A satyr born to the plane of Theros, Xenagos spent much of his life romping around with his clan of fellow satyrs. His favourite activities included partying and drinking until his planeswalker spark ignited and he was able to travel away from Theros. After visiting many planes and seeing the expanse of the Multiverse his return to his native plane did not come with a feeling of home. He could now see how insignificant his life was before his awakening and even still after. Driven by a desire for power, his mission now is to enter the Therosian pantheon as a god. Main article: Magic Story Theros was sold in 16-card boosters (one card being a marketing card ), five intro packs , one event decks , and a fat pack . There are no 6-card boosters or Booster Battle Packs . The boosters feature artwork from: Thassa, God of the Sea ; Erebos, God of the Dead ; Purphoros, God of the Forge ; Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Arena Athlete . Theros featured an unprecedented first for organized play: a block-long Magic entertainment experience that would see players complete nine quests on the Hero's Path (three during Theros and six during Born of the Gods and Journey into Nyx ). Hero cards debuted as part of the Hero's Path. These cards are not for use in tournament decks but instead are awarded to players for completing quests along the Hero's Path. They can use them to defeat later quests. Each card is double-faced, one side featuring a code redeemable for a Planeswalker Points achievement while the other side features game mechanics players can use to help defeat a Game Day Challenge Deck . The first quest in the Hero's Path was during the Theros Prerelease on September 21 and 22, 2013. There players could choose their heroic path based on a favorite mana color ( white , blue , black , red , or green ), receive a Seeded Prerelease pack , and join fellow heroes on a social scavenger hunt. The Seeded Prerelease Pack contained a spindown life counter , a Hero card unique to a player's chosen path (respectively The Protector , The Philosopher , The Avenger , The Warrior , and The Hunter ), one of five quiz activity cards, five Theros boosters , and a seeded booster featuring cards appropriate for that player's chosen path (including one of the playable five Prerelease promo cards). While building decks and playing matches players could work together to find the answers to the questions about Theros on their activity cards. This social scavenger hunt offered players an opportunity to engross themselves in the lore of the new block and interact with their fellow heroes. Once a player had filled out the card, he or she could check the answer key to see if they completed it correctly. Theros launched to the public on September 27, 2013 and kicked off with Friday Night Magic . Hero's Path Quest #2 brought players to their store to receive a \u201cGift from the Gods\u201d by solving a puzzle hidden within a Poster Puzzle. Once they had discovered the solution they could report it to receive a second Hero card ( The Harvester ). On October 19 and 20 Theros Game Day players could use their Standard decks for the third quest on the Hero's Path: Face the Hydra . Using a special Challenge Deck provided to the retailer, players could battle the Hydra , one of the epic monsters of the plane of Theros. The Challenge Deck is a special self-running deck with its own set of rules. Players are encouraged to pilot it against one another one-on-one or in groups of up to four with guidance from the included instructional playmat . A player didn't need to participate in the Game Day tournament to attempt to defeat the Hydra. This was the first opportunity for players to utilize the Hero cards they received at the Prerelease and Launch Weekend. Beating the Hydra also awarded players their third Hero card ( The Slayer ), which they'll be able to use for quests at future Hero's Path events.

Theros has a strong enchantment theme with widespread use of the Enchantment type alongside other card types ( enchantment creatures and enchantment artifacts ). Enchantments are primarily used to represent the Gods \u2014 which themselves are enchantment creatures \u2014 and their influence. Some enchantment creatures feature the new keyword ability bestow which lets the player cast the card as an Aura with enchant creature for the bestow cost. It then conveys a bonus to the enchanted creature. If the creature it enchants dies, the enchantment itself reverts to a creature, usually with the same features as the abilities it conveyed as an Aura. Another mechanic tied to the gods is devotion . Similar to chroma , it scales effects based on the number of mana symbols on permanents a player controls. Humans also tie into the enchantment theme with the heroic ability word. Cards with heroic trigger an ability when its controller casts a spell targeting it. Scry appears in Theros as a returning mechanic. Theros is also a plane filled with monsters such as Hydras , Kraken , Demons , and others. These all feature the new keyword action monstrosity . Upon activation, if the creature isn't \u201c monstrous \u201d already, a certain number of +1/+1 counters are put on the creature and it becomes \u201cmonstrous\u201d. Usually this is accompanied by a triggered ability when the creature becomes \u201cmonstrous\u201d. Additionally, the Hero's Path features Hero's Reward . Theros introduces the supertype Elite , the card type Hero , and the creature types God , Sable , and Head . It reintroduces the creature type Nymph . Theros has fourteen cycles .
