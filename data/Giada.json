{"text": "Giada is a teenaged girl and the youngest angel on New Capenna . At the Cabaretti Crescendo , she was revealed to be The Font , a new source of Halo . She sacrificed herself to save Elspeth Tirel and was revived with Halo during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse . Giada's origins are unknown, but she appeared as a teenage girl with dark eyes in clothes a size too large for her frame. Although she appeared young, she may have existed since at least when the demons betrayed the angels , as no new angels were known to have been created since the city's founding. As a young girl from the orphan halls of the Mezzio 's lower districts, she was the Cabaretti's best-kept secret, New Capenna's greatest hope, and the other families' most dangerous threat. Discovered by Cabaretti talent scouts, Giada fast became a favorite of Jinnie Fay 's and Jetmir 's greatest treasure. A gifted singer, she fit in well with her cohort of Cabaretti ingenue, socialites, and starlets. But unlike the rest of them, she had a gift never before encountered in New Capenna: with a touch and a wish, she could turn even the foulest city sewage into pure Halo. The Cabaretti hurried to keep her under wraps, but their appetite for the magic substance overrode their caution: their parties, already legendarily Halo-fueled, grew to excess. Elspeth protects Giada from the Families and the Adversary . In a time of increasing scarcity and desperation for Halo among the other families, the Cabaretti were unaffected. With Giada, the Cabaretti didn't need to restrain themselves. With Giada, the balance of power in the city had been turned on its head. During the events of the Crescendo , she was rescued from agents of the Adversary by Elspeth Tirel . Joining with Elspeth and Vivien Reid , the trio reached a cathedral in Park Heights , where she sacrificed herself to save her new friends, transforming into the magic of Halo and reinvigorating Elspeth, as well as gifting her the Halo-infused sword Luxior, to help her defeat Nixilis. Her actions made it possible for the other angels to return to New Capenna. Weeks later, as Atraxa's forces threatened to overwhelm the city of New Capenna, the resistance fighters hatched a last-ditch plan: topple Park Heights and crush Atraxa herself. Instrumental to that plan was the street artist Errant , who was entrusted with placing the charges that would topple the skyscrapers. Little did she know that she was being closely watched by the now fully formed angel Giada, whose corporeal form had been restored with Halo. If the plan succeeded, it would give the restored angels of New Capenna the chance they needed to turn the tide of battle across the Multiverse . Though she never made her presence known to Errant, Giada was there with her every step of the way, lending extra potency to her halo cartridges and shielding her from the worst of the harm. And it was Giada at the end who ensured Errant was rescued by one of her sisters instead of falling to her death as Park Heights collapsed. After Atraxa 's death, Giada left Capenna to help the denizens of other planes alongside her fellow angels. Due to the portals created by Realmbreaker , Giada can travel to other planes.
