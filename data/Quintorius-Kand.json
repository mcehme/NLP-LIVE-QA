During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , his spark ignited , and he became a planeswalker . Quint's mind is piled high with facts and knowledge that might become useful. Being a Lorehold student, his magic usually comes from scrolls or a tome; blasting out like bladed sharp paper golden energy He views the accuracy of historical accounts as extremely important. He is an expert loremaster. The truth is also a priority to him as it enables the preservation of facts rather than myths. Quintorius has access to white and red mana . Quint was born as the son of a poor nomadic shepherd. he'd always known that he could cause things to move, twist and turn, and suddenly fall at opportune times. At home, he'd used these magical gifts to stop runaway sheep from straying too far from the flock. Before he began his study at Strixhaven he unsuccessfully attended the Rundlestrom Military Academy where he had been expelled because of his clumsiness. As a student, Quint spends most of his time inside the grand Biblioplex digging through old books for his research. He attended Strixhaven University on a scholarship but supplemented his remaining tuition fees by working on a dig site with a team of researchers. Quint wished to learn about the history and past of the Loxodon race by uncovering great unknowns. He studied hard to make a name for himself and his family. While being a committed student, he suffered from wanderlust, always feeling the need and desire to travel and explore. He wanted to find out who he truly was and believed he could do so through his expeditions to significant historical places. With the help of his spirit mentor Asterion , Quint rediscovered the lost Loxodon city of Zantafar in the caves nearby Strixhaven . When New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse started, the Phyrexians quickly burned through the defenses of Strixhaven. Professor Vess tasked a small group of surviving students - Quint, Zimone Wola , Rootha Squallheart , Dina and Killian Lu - to search for the Invocation of the Founders in the Biblioplex. The group found it and with a representative from each school they could activate it, but the compleated Nassari distracted Rootha enough that Quint could only try to make up her contribution with raw magic and lifeforce. The result was not entirely successful, and in the process, Quint's spark ignited and he planeswalked away. A year later, Quint appeared on the plane of Ixalan . He traveled there in order to investigate the existence of a civilization that predates all others on the plane and employed the help of Ixalan's spirits to do so. Quint appeared in the trailer for Strixhaven: School of Mages . Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
