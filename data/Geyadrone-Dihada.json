{"text": "Geyadrone Dihada is a powerful and ancient demonic planeswalker who first appeared on Dominaria between the fall of the Thran and the Brothers' War . Dihada is a demonic female and can manipulate her form. The upper half of her body is similar to a woman, with gray skin, long black hair, eyes with white pupils, and two arms with claw hands. The lower half of her body is made up of legs that end in tentacles (akin to octopuses) with gray and purple suckers. She is a powerful mage with a vast knowledge of magic. Her magical expertise is in corrupting, enslaving, and manipulating creatures. Dihada had access to red , black , white , and blue mana . Geyadrone Dihada is an incredibly ancient demonic planeswalker . Her schemes span millennia, and her lust for power and dominance knows no limits. She is compelled to bring the most powerful beings under her control. Sometimes, as with the Elder Dragons Chromium and Piru , she finds the champions she seeks and binds them with powerful spells. Sometimes she finds creatures with great potential and molds them, corrupts them, to suit her needs. So, it was with the Maro-Sorcerer Sol'Kanar and the planeswalker Dakkon whom she corrupted into monsters so that they might better serve her. After absorbing Piru 's energy Dihada temporarily loses control over her form and ends up looking more monstrous. When first seen she instructed Dakkon to forge the Black Blade for her in return for the power of a planeswalker. She returned after ten years and either triggered his planeswalker's spark or otherwise granted him power, but she then absorbed his shadow and his soul into the blade. Dakkon was left wandering the planes, wondering why Dihada would grant him so much power, only to make him her enemy. Later she corrupted the nature spirit of Khone , Sol'Kanar , gave him the Black Blade, and set about conquering Corondor . Sol'Kanar created her Unholy Citadel from the remains of slain enemies, which crept across the land on giant legs of bone. Dihada after the Great Mending. Many years later, she tricked a boy named for the kingdom of Carth into summoning Dakkon and bound the planeswalker to himself. This effectively robbed Dakkon of his planeswalking ability and allowed Dihada to mark him as her champion. The boy had Dakkon attack her, but she summoned the Elder Dragons Piru and Rhuell to fight him. Dakkon killed Piru in a blast so powerful that it ripped the group apart and created the Dueling Chasm of Golthonor . This allowed Dihada to absorb the dragon's life force and power. Dakkon then turned on her, but she managed to stall him just long enough to place her mark on him. Because of their intensity, the battles between them would become known as the Blackblade\u2013Dihada War , even though they lasted only a few days. Afterward, she left Dominaria and wasn't seen until the Planeswalkers' War on Corondor, many millennia later. It's unknown what happened during that war, but another participant was Jared Carthalion , a descendant of Carth, the boy who had summoned Dakkon. Dihada left Dominaria at the close of the Planeswalker War, a few years before the Phyrexian Invasion . The people of Dominaria believed that she still lived (though in diminished form), for legend said that Sol'Kanar would be restored to his original form upon her death and that he still ruled as a demon king in Corondor to the day. Dihada made a reappearance during the second Phyrexian Invasion at the Tolarian Academy at Lat-Nam . At some point, she disposed of the Academy's archmage and took his place. She seems to have sided with the Phyrexians. Dakkon Blackblade Jared Carthalion Dominaria Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
