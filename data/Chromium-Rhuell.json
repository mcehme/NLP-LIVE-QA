{"text": "Chromium Rhuell was a famous Elder Dragon with shapeshifting powers. He was long and sleek, his scales had a metallic sheen, and he had confident and curious nature. He was brother to Merrevia Sal , Nicol Bolas , Arcades Sabboth , Palladia-Mors , and Ugin . He was cousin to Vaevictis Asmadi and Piru , who was also his life partner. With Piru, he was father to Crosis . Chromium was killed by Tevesh Szat at the end of the Ice Age . After being spawned by the Ur-Dragon , Chromium was the second Elder Dragon to name himself. After his birth, he immediately set out to study the nature of the plane he was born onto, trying to understand the underlying order of the world. Early on, he taught himself to shapeshift into a human form, so that he could walk among the people of the rising nations. During the Elder Dragon War instigated by Nicol Bolas , Chromium took to hiding himself amongst the humans. Thus, he was one of the few survivors of the War. Chromium and his life partner Piru eventually became servants of the planeswalker Geyadrone Dihada . One day they were summoned by her to fight Dakkon Blackblade . Dakkon tried to take control over Chromium and to force him to kill Piru, but he fought back and drained most of Dakkon's life away. With the last of his power, the planeswalker teleported Chromium to an unknown location. Piru was less fortunate however, for shortly afterwards Dakkon was reunited with the Black Blade and used it to kill the dragon. It is unknown how Chromium ceased his service to Dihada, or how he dealt with Piru's death. The next time he was seen he posed in human form as \"Ham, the Tickery Man\", and was a member of the High Council of Mors Ridge who was in charge of casting the \"tickery\" spell, making sure his sister Palladia remained sleeping beneath Mors Ridge to keep her from attacking humans. However their cousin Vaevictus managed to wake her up, needing her to lift the curse that had turned him into a whelp. Palladia did so, and together with an army they went on the rampage. Chromium though was able to convince Vaevictis to turn on Palladia, but Palladia reversed one of Vaevictis' spells , and he disappeared from the battle. Finally, Chromium and Ad'Amra , a human warrior spellcaster who had fallen in love with \"Ham\", managed to put the sleep-spell back on Palladia. Shortly after this, Chromium once again pledged allegiance to a planeswalker, this time to Faralyn . In his service, Chromium befriended the planeswalker's spellsquire, Ravidel . During this time, Arcades Sabboth was forcibly summoned by Leshrac to fight Kristina , and in effect was killed by her. As the Shard of the Twelve Worlds closed, Chromium was caught inside it. In -2934 AR, Faralyn called for a meeting with several other planeswalkers that were caught inside as well, the so-called Summit of the Null Moon . Tensions were high however, for the people present all had a history with one another: Leshrac and Kristina were among those who where invited. To make matters worse, Faralyn had secretly betrayed them. He, Leshrac, and Tevesh Szat planned to start fighting between the people present, hoping that the death of a planeswalker would provide enough energy for them to escape the Shard. No planeswalker died, but Szat killed Chromium, who apparently was powerful enough to allow them to escape to the plane of Shandalar . During the battle, Ravidel was killed as well, but Kristina and her lover Taysir joined forces to return him to life. Instead of being grateful, Ravidel was furious that they saved him instead of Chromium. Ravidel plotted vengeance for ages, gradually becoming more and more insane. Eventually this would lead him into starting the Planeswalkers' War . Ravidel took Chromium's corpse and fashioned it into what he called a Planar Barge, which he used to carry his army while planeswalking."}
