{"text": "Soldev was a city-state in Terisiare at the time of the Dominarian Ice Age . It was inhabited by expert machinists who loved to work with artifacts . The semi-autonomous city was located in the north of Kjeldor , on the ruins of Storgard and near the Raynor Glacier . One Soldevi, Sorine Relicbane , was outspoken against the use of the machines, fearing a repeat of the Brothers' War . He was branded a heretic for his efforts. Soldev's greatest artificer , Arcum Dagsson , was the chief proponent for the machines. Ultimately, it was his machines that destroyed Soldev when they escaped control."}
