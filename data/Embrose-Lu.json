{"text": "Dean Embrose Lu is a human warlock teacher at the Silverquill College of Strixhaven University on Arcavios . Dean Embrose of Silverquill is a master poet whose ink magic is dominating and without mercy. Quick with a cutting remark, Dean Embrose has seen many mage-students scrubs out of Strixhaven and has nothing good to say about those who can't hack it. A cynic, Embrose believes that most people are in it for themselves. He demands his students learn how to use language-based magic to \"get what they deserve.\" While he often fights with Dean Shaile , he holds a deep (begrudging) respect for the owlin . He is the father of Killian Lu , and is even stricter with him than he is with other students. His parental nature is often shown only in implicit and exclusionary behavior. During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Embrose Lu defeated a host of compleated faculty members, allowing his son and his friends to find the Invocation of the Founders . He and Liliana Vess were two of the few remaining professors in Strixhaven. Quoted or referred to:"}
