{"text": "Vadrok , the Thunder-Raptor , is the apex monster of the Raugrin triome on Ikoria . Vadrok is a massive catlike dragon. Named after the terrible rumbling it produces as it streaks across the sky, Vadrok rules the skies of Raugrin. It may not be the biggest or fastest monster in the sky, but it is by far the fiercest. Vadrok generates magical energy as it flies, then releases it through its breath of flame so brightly blue that it is almost white. The sages say Vadrok's flames have magical properties that can cause all sorts of devastating effects, but the final result always seems to be the same: death. Vadrok's uncontested dominance and mobility mean it is liable to show up just about anywhere in Raugrin, and many city dwellers from other triomes derisively refer to the region as \"Vadrok Turf.\" Vadrok makes its nest in the Shroka Peaks , a strand of tall rocky columns in Raugrin. The nest, a basin of smooth black glass, holds a collection of eggs seemingly made of the same volcanic glass. Its hunting grounds span the full length of Raugrin and even parts of Ketria . The planeswalker Vivien Reid believes Vadrok has the longest hunting ground of every monster on the plane . Long ago Vadrok burned a human sanctuary to ash. The magical fire not only destroyed the city but also erased all memories of its existence. Only the sage Rielle knows this mythos. During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Jirina Kudro led a column of survivors from the destroyed city of Drannith into Vadrok's lair, to lure in Lukka , the compleated planeswalker leading the invasion. Lukka arrived and battled Vadrok, but the apex monster's magical flames stripped Lukka's corrupted biomass, letting Vadrok extract the planeswalker. After discarding Lukka's corpse, Vadrok turned to the amassed citizens, but after a moment of consideration, declined to attack and departed. Associated cards: Depicted in: Referred to:"}
