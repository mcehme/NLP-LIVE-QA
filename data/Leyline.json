{"text": "Leyline in front of an Island Leylines , sometimes called mana lines , are ancient mana paths that flow and crisscross each other across a given landscape. All planes have a network of leylines. All leylines are enchantments . All leylines other than the first ( Ley Line ) allow you to begin the game with them on the battlefield if it is in your opening hand , since leylines are found rather than cast. There have been three cycles of Leylines with the \"opening hand\" clause, all with a 2MM cost. They were printed in Guildpact , Magic 2011 and Core Set 2020 . However, due to their utility as sideboard cards, three have been reprinted, one twice, resulting in a total of 11. Nissa Revane is especially adept in manipulating leylines. On Ravnica the leylines formed the Implicit Maze . On Amonkhet , the leylines coalesced into the gods . On Zendikar the leylines connected the hedrons . A focal point of the leylines could be found in the Singing City . Eldrazi are known to follow leylines. On Innistrad Nahiri created cryptoliths to bend the leylines to her will, and to summon Emrakul . Associated cards: Quoted or referred to:"}
