{"text": "Squee was a goblin cabin-hand on the Skyship Weatherlight . He is known for his foul cooking, love of eating bugs, and manner of speaking. Because goblins on Dominaria are named by the mother while birthing, Squee is a quite common name. The name indicates that the birth was quite difficult. When he was only ten years old, Squee saved Captain Sisay from his tribe and was exiled in response, leading him to request to join the Weatherlight' s crew as a cabin boy. A genius - among Dominarian goblins at least - Squee was loyal to the crew and managed to save their lives on several occasions, taking a particularly important role during their time on Mercadia when, as a goblin, he was perceived to be one of the elite Kyrens and thus became an elite himself. At some point, the Salvation Sphere found its way to him, protecting the purity of his soul. During the Phyrexian Invasion , Squee was captured by the Phyrexians, and granted immortality by Yawgmoth , so that he might be killed repeatedly by Ertai and Crovax . This backfired and allowed Squee to accidentally kill Ertai. His immortality outlasted the war and he survived centuries longer. He can now rightly claim to be the oldest, and possibly the wisest, goblin of Dominaria. About a century before 4562, Squee became the king of a goblin clan , winning a trial by combat by tiring his opponent to death, a tactic he had developed while pit-fighting. Although he ushered in a new age of peace and progress, his clan was slowly infiltrated by Ertai 's sleeper agents, and Squee was captured by Ertai and fully Compleated . However, Squee's body blew up the mountain and squished himself, destroying the Phyrexian cell in the process. Finding himself in a changed extradimensional space, Squee learned from Salvation that his soul had been removed from his body by the compleation process, and only by virtue of the body destroying itself did he have a chance to return. He was given a choice between dying permanently or returning to immortality, but chose a third option instead: being revived again, but only once more, becoming a mortal goblin again. Squee fought alongside Slimefoot in defense of Dominaria during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse . Though not a planeswalker, Squee traveled through the Multiverse as a crewmember of the Skyship Weatherlight . Dominaria Mercadia During Weatherlight design and development, Jennifer Clarke-Wilkes was put in charge of establishing Squee's mannerisms and style of speech. In the Un-iverse , Squee is a casino hand rather than a cabin hand. Despite losing his immortality during the events of Dominaria United, Slimefoot and Squee has a self-reanimation ability, seemingly referring back to Squee's past immortality. It's implied he only regained it temporarily in order to fight back against the returned Phyrexians, or one of Slimefoot's abilities has similar properties to Squee's former immortality. Represented in: Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to: \u2191 The Tempest Characters page notes Squee was 10 when he joined the crew of the Skyship Weatherlight . As he is already serving on the crew in Part Two of Born to Greatness in 4195, he must have been born by 4185 AR."}
