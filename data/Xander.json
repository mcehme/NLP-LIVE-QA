{"text": "Lord Xander was the crime-lord and boss of the Maestros family in New Capenna . He was killed by Ob Nixilis during the events of Streets of New Capenna . The vampire Lord Xander was an avid fashionista, who had been alive since before the founding of the city. . He would think of himself first among equals if any equals presented themselves to him. Until that happened, he reigned as the self-appointed curator of New Capenna's history and orchestrator of its present. The history he staged through exhibitions in the Maestros's many galleries, museums, and archives. The present he orchestrated through the Maestros's skilled, discreet assassins for hire. A former assassin himself, injuries to his right knee often forced him to use a cane concealing a hidden blade outside his quarters. In his quarters, Xander has a hidden storeroom cramped with all manner of ancient relics. These were the last remaining histories of the founding of New Capenna, a time he no longer remembered due to the distortions of time and the magic of the deal. Lord Xander was once an ailing artist of an all-but-dead aristocratic house, jealous over the critical acclaim his younger peers received. He was offered the gift of eternal life from the plane's archdemons , and he accepted, unwittingly receiving the curse of vampirism in the process. He was one of the five heads of families that were appointed by the archdemons and original signatories of the contract that created New Capenna. The deal made him part demon himself, as demonstrated by his long horns, one of which was tipped with gold. He was the progenitor of the plane's other vampires, including his former lover Evelyn . He was burdened by three gifts: vampirism, which granted him all but eternal life; a demonic blessing, which granted him power; and a crown, whose weight he couldn't feel now that noble titles meant nothing. Taken together, Lord Xander bore the mantle of the collector and curator of New Capenna. Curation was exhausting work, a labor that had increasingly begun to remind him of his old life before the city rose and the age of knights , lords , and monsters fell behind. On the night of the New Year during the Crescendo , Xander was killed by Ob Nixilis . He willed control of the Maestros to his deputy, Anhelo . Xander appears in the trailer for Streets of New Capenna . Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
