{"text": "Jhoira (JOY-ruh) is a nearly immortal Shivan artificer of the Ghitu tribe who studied at the Tolarian Academy on Dominaria . Jhoira is a near-immortal woman with almond brown skin and reddish-brown hair that she often carries in a messy braid. The planeswalker Karn considers her his one and only true friend. Born to the nomadic Ghitu tribe of Shiv , Jhoira left her people to learn more about artifice and bring that knowledge back to her people. Slightly older than Teferi , she was Karn 's first friend after his activation and gave him his name. She was used by Kerrick to infiltrate the Academy. This caused the temporal disaster that destroyed the first Academy and left Jhoira stranded on Tolaria for ten years until the Headmaster Urza returned to found a new Academy. Surviving by mapping the boundaries of the time rifts, she devised a method to save her fellow student Teferi from certain death and enabled the academics to access the different time rifts. Jhoira herself became nearly immortal due to her experiences at Tolaria following the disaster. She managed to rig a means to collect water from a pool that had been affected by the temporal rifts. Drinking that water slowed the aging process to a near-absolute standstill, causing her appearance to age days over the centuries. Her hair grew wild, her muscles grew taut, and her skin turned an even darker bronze. Jhoira was the first captain of the skyship Weatherlight , rescuing thousands of refugees from Serra's Realm as the plane collapsed. Taking the refugees to Zhalfir , she reunited with Teferi, who asked for her hand in marriage, though she declined. Afterward, she returned to Shiv to oversee powerstone production, as well as acting as ambassador to the viashino . During the Phyrexian Invasion , her homeland was phased out along with Teferi's. Nearly three hundred years later, she returned to Dominaria along with Teferi, who was trying to bring the phased-out continents back safely and close the rifts that threatened the Multiverse . For Jhoira to feel more at ease with the task, Teferi summoned two Ghitu warriors and two Viashino to accompany them. After losing a battle against Nicol Bolas , Teferi gave up his planeswalker's spark to seal the time rift over Shiv, restoring the continent to its rightful form. Unbeknownst to Teferi, Jhoira wore an amulet around her neck, which contained a small Powerstone holding his Planeswalker spark. She has made this stone herself at the Thran Mana Rig . Moving to seal the other rifts, Teferi, Jhoira, and Venser teleported to Urborg , shifting to an alternate timeline in which the Ice Age never ended and Lord Windgrace was battling another Phyrexian invasion . Realizing the potential of Venser's latent spark, Teferi and Jhoira used their magic to help Venser complete his first planeswalk back to the Dominaria they knew. Afterward, Jhoira searched for Jodah , another immortal, and they would become romantically involved. In the end, the relationship didn't work out. Sixty years after the Mending , Jhoira managed to locate the remains of the Weatherlight off the coast of Urborg . She salvaged the Thran metal frame, the powerstone , and the engines. Rebuilding it with a weatherseed she managed to get the ship fly worthy again, and assembled a new crew to fight against the rising Cabal . Flying to Tolaria West , Jhoira and her crew found a Cabal agent who revealed the existence of the Blackblade . They realized this could be a possible weapon in their fight against Belzenlok , the leader of the Cabal. After the crew unexpectedly was reinforced by several planeswalkers, Jhoira finally found the right moment to hand over the powerstone containing Teferi's spark to its rightful owner. Now fully manned, the Weatherlight attacked the Stronghold where they fought Yargle . After the fight against Yargle, Jhoira handed the Weatherlight over to Shanna Sisay , and returned to the Mana Rig on Shiv . When news of the Second Phyrexian invasion reached her, Jhoira brought her formidable intellect and experience to the New Coalition and served as one of its leaders. She was present for the battle against Sheoldred and the other Phyrexians at the Mana Rig. Afterward, she remained in Shiv to rally the dragons, viashino, goblins, and Ghitu to protect their land from future Phyrexian attacks. Though not a planeswalker, Jhoira traveled through the Multiverse as a crewmember of the Skyship Weatherlight . Dominaria Serra's Realm Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to: For Future Sight , R&D created a quirky version of Jhoira as an old lady, but this was never printed. Adeliz is close with - and possibly be the daughter of - Jodah and Jhoira. The first spell Jhoira learned from Teferi jolted its target with an electric shock. The spell quickly became infamous at the Tolarian Academy."}
