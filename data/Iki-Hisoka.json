{"text": "Sensei Iki Hisoka (hee-SOH-kah) was a headmaster of the Minamo Academy on the plane of Kamigawa . He was once a prodigious child with a natural talent for countermagic . Admired for his skill at spell-sparring, his gifts coalesced into a philosophy, and he became first a teacher, and later headmaster of the school. However, the older he got, the more his magical abilities worsened and the more he became a bureaucrat instead of a mage and scholar. He was present in Eiganjo when Konda performed the crime that started the Kami War . Later, he became in fact a puppet in the hands of the soratami and Mochi , the Smiling Kami of the Crescent Moon. When Choryu , a student of Minamo, killed Kobo , the apprentice of the ogre shaman Hidetsugu , he brought the revenge of the Hyozan Reckoners upon the school. When the ogre attacked and destroyed most of the school, Hisoka tried to parley with him about the safe evacuation of his people. The ogre refused, and Hisoka's life ended in the jaws of Hidetsugu.
