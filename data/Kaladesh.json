{"text": "Kaladesh Booster Battle Packs Card comparisons Deck Builder's Toolkit Planeswalker decks Kaladesh is the 72nd Magic expansion, and the first in the Kaladesh block . It was released on September 30, 2016, and is a large expansion . It is set on the plane of the same name . Kaladesh contains 264 cards (15 basic lands, 101 commons, 80 uncommons, 53 rares, 15 mythic rares) and includes randomly inserted premium versions of all cards. The expansion symbol is a Far Eastern inspired floral motif, representing the aether of the plane. Kaladesh premieres Planeswalker decks , which replace Intro packs . These contain 10 additional cards that are considered to be part of the set (2 mythic planeswalkers, 2 rares, 2 uncommons, 2 commons and 2 common dual lands). These are numbered #265/264 to #274/264). The Fat pack for this set was reimagined as the Kaladesh Bundle . Although Wizards of the Coast used the ligature \u00c6 \u2014 the A and E combined into one letter \u2014 for aether since the beginning of the game, this was changed for Kaladesh , which features the stuff heavily. According to Blake Rasmussen , it caused way more issues than it was worth (particularly in translation). The set introduces create as a new vocabulary word. Create is used when a card or effect puts a token onto the battlefield . Kaladesh (first glimpsed in Magic Origins as the birthplane of Chandra Nalaar ) is a plane where natural mages are rare. Work that would be done with magic on other planes is instead accomplished through devices. The automatons, thopters , and other artifact creatures of the plane are fueled by aether , which is heavily trafficked. Artifacts are built as much for beauty as for function. Fire magic is strictly banned, and pyromancy punishable with a death sentence. Chandra returns to Kaladesh and saves her mother from her nemesis Baral . The Gatewatch unexpectedly is confronted by the scheming Tezzeret . Kaladesh is ruled by the Consulate . Their forces and works are nearly omnipresent. Pivotal story moments are now marked with Story Spotlight at the bottom of the card accompanied by an iterator and the total number of spotlight cards. They all have a planeswalker watermark to help signify that they are Story Spotlight cards. The cards that represent the Story Spotlights in Kaladesh are: Inventors' Fair , Captured by the Consulate , Deadlock Trap , Fateful Showdown and Confiscation Coup . They also refer to the new storyline url mtgstory.com . Main article: Magic Story Kaladesh is sold in 16-card boosters (one card being a marketing card ), two planeswalker decks , the Kaladesh bundle , a Deck Builder's Toolkit , Booster Battle Packs and a Gift Box . The boosters feature artwork from Saheeli Rai , Dovin Baan , Demon of Dark Schemes , Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Angel of Invention . Prerelease Events took place on September 24, 2016. In addition to the normal spindown life counter and stamped premium foil promo card, Prerelease Packs contain a little make-your-own-thopter insert. Building on the success of the Zendikar Expeditions , Wizards of the Coast expanded the product in the Masterpiece Series . For the Kaladesh Block they are called Kaladesh Inventions . These are all premium foil cards with a special Kaladeshi card frame and a separate expansion symbol. Thus, they are not part of the set. Kaladesh Inventions are all artifacts , include all new art and flavor text set on Kaladesh and appear slightly more often than premium mythic rares. These cards are playable in limited and formats where they're already legal . There are 30 Invention cards appearing with Kaladesh and 24 more cards appear in Aether Revolt . Main article: Kaladesh Inventions Prerelease : a stamped card that can be any rare or mythic rare from the set. Launch promo : Saheeli's Artistry Game Day : full-art Essence Extraction Game Day (Top 8): full-art Cultivator of Blades Buy-a-Box : Skyship Stalker As a holiday promotion, starting November 26, purchasers of a booster display box of Kaladesh received two bonus holiday packs. These boosters contain: A premium card from a currently legal Standard set (excluding Oath of the Gatewatch and double-faced cards , but including Zendikar Expeditions and Kaladesh Inventions ). Two non-premium cards that are either rare or a mythic rare from a Battle for Zendikar through Kaladesh . This content is the same as that of the previously announced Standard Showdown packs. Kaladesh features 9 tokens and 3 emblems . 6/6 Beast for Architect of the Untamed */* Construct for Metallurgic Summonings and Oviya Pashiri, Sage Lifecrafter */* Construct 1/1 Servo for any card with fabricate as well as Animation Module , Cogworker's Puzzleknot , Master Trinketeer and Oviya Pashiri, Sage Lifecrafter 1/1 Servo 1/1 Servo 1/1 Thopter with flying for Experimental Aviator , Pia Nalaar , Whirlermaker , Whirler Virtuoso 1/1 Thopter with flying 1/1 Thopter with flying Emblem for Chandra, Torch of Defiance Emblem for Nissa, Vital Force Emblem for Dovin Baan Energy Reserve markers were inadvertently omitted from the initial print run of Kaladesh . They do appear in subsequent print runs, such as Kaladesh boosters included in Aether Revolt prerelease packs. Two cards exclusive to the Nissa Planeswalker Deck had their illustration credit swapped. Guardian of the Great Conduit \u2014 miscredited to Magali Villeneuve; it should be Christine Choi. Terrain Elemental \u2014 miscredited to Christine Choi; it should be Magali Villeneuve. Kaladesh is a set with less complexity than some of its recent predecessors., as there are only two new named mechanics: Crew \u2014 a keyword ability that enables vehicles to become artifact creatures until end of turn . To activate the crew ability, tap any number of creatures you control with total power equal to or greater than the crew number. Because the crew ability doesn't use the tap symbol , you can tap any untapped creature you control, even one that just entered the battlefield. You can even tap an animated Vehicle to crew another Vehicle. Fabricate \u2014 when a creature with Fabricate enters the battlefield you may put a number of +1/+1 counters on the creature, or create a number of 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature tokens. The number after fabricate tells you how many +1/+1 counters or Servos you get. There are no returning named mechanics (save evergreen ones). However Inventors' Fair notably utilizes Metalcraft , and Gearseeker Serpent has Affinity for artifacts. Energy counters (marked with an ) are a new resource , placed on players in form of a counter . They are used to pay the cost to activate abilities. Energy counters represent aether , a magical energy that is found throughout the Multiverse , and is an integral part of the ecosystem on Kaladesh . Most cards that give you energy counters also give you a way to spend them. Energy counters that you get from one card can be saved up and spent on abilities of other cards. Energy counters don't go away as phases or steps end, or as the turn ends. The only way for you to lose them is to spend them. Kaladesh introduces the Vehicle artifact\u00a0subtype, the Aetherborn , Pilot , and Servo creature types, as well as the Saheeli and Dovin planeswalker subtypes. The set also reintroduces the Monkey creature type, which had been erased in the Ninth Edition . Vehicle cards have a special bronze and grey blocked card frame .

Main article: Kaladesh/Card comparisons Smuggler's Copter is an artifact vehicle which allowed for blisteringly fast attacks on turn 3 while providing card selection at a low cost. It was banned alongside Emrakul, the Promised End (from Eldritch Moon ) and Reflector Mage (from Oath of the Gatewatch ) on January 9, 2017 in an attempt to fix and increase the variety of standard decks. The success of this was questionable, due to the events described below. Amazingly enough, the card was nearly even more powerful: having vigilance removed as a last-minute nerf. Saheeli Rai was seen originally as a below-par, Johnny -centric planeswalker that was the face of the set. However, with the release of a complementary card in Felidar Guardian in Aether Revolt , a two-card instant-kill combo known as Copy Cat was now present in Standard, and one that R&D had not foreseen. A perfected decklist, formed in the later stages of Aether Revolt standard, was powerful enough that only one realistic counter-deck of Mardu Vehicles could stand against the combo. Adding to this the fact that R&D did not have the deck in playtesting, and it would take eighteen months to rotate, meant that Felidar Guardian needed to be banned. Aetherworks Marvel was the centrepiece of Marvel , a standard deck based on collecting large reserves of energy and using them to freecast high-impact, expensive spells on turn 4. Thought to be the premiere combo deck in Pro Tour Kaladesh, the all-in version proved to be unreliable and easily disrupted. An aggro-hybrid version emerged in the later stages of the Kaladesh standard, but due to the bannings of Emrakul, the Promised End and the superior combo of Copy Cat, the Marvel strategy was suppressed until the banning of Felidar Guardian after the release of Amonkhet . While the deck was not overwhelming unlike Copy Cat, the experience of occasionally losing on the fourth turn through Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger proved to be damaging to Standard, leading to the ban of Marvel on June 14, 2017. Following rotation and the release of Ixalan , the new Tribal set did not instil any amount of creativity into the meta-game, with the disruptable synergies not coming close to base-rate cards in the Energy or mono-Red decks. Analysis from the Magic Online results showed that the Red deck had absurdly good matchups against anything in the format that was not Energy-based, resulting in a similar field to the Mardu vs Saheeli duality after Aether Revolt. These results were cited for the bannings in January 2018; Attune with Aether was chosen alongside Rogue Refiner to be banned to weaken the Energy deck, while Ramunap Ruins and Rampaging Ferocidon were banned from the Ramunap Red deck.
