{"text": "Compleation is the state of Phyrexian maturity and perfection. Compleation entails the replacement of much of a person's organic parts with artifice, which typically causes the death of their original organic body. The being retains its memory and personality, but loses its soul and is endowed with a fanatical desire to serve Phyrexia. Originally, compleation involved indoctrination followed by mechanical augments to be finalized with the application of glistening oil . With the changes brought about by the reformation of Phyrexia on Mirrodin , however, now is as follows: First, the subject is exposed to glistening oil which initiates the process of phyresis . Soon, major headaches and changes in personality are noticed in the subject, noticeably a desire to experience Phyrexia's perfection. Genetic mutations start to occur in the body a few hours after exposure to oil. A black ichor will replace all bodily fluids. If the project is successful, the subject is then guided to a surgery table where splicers perform operations that will repurpose the subject to whatever is required of them. These operations might include flaying of skin and its replacement with metal, the replacement of veins and arteries with metallic cables and, almost always, expose the subject to intense pain. If the procedure of compleation has fatal results, the husk will then be reanimated by necromantic magic. After that, the subject is considered perfect and they are introduced within the ranks of Phyrexians where they will be indoctrinated to serve Phyrexia. The compleation of artificial beings requires an inverse synthesis of flesh and bone onto their metallic skeletons. As compleation removes the soul, it was originally not possible to compleat a planeswalker and have them remain a planeswalker, as the planeswalker's spark is contained within the soul. Additionally, pre-Mending planeswalkers didn't have actual physical bodies to compleat. However, through Jin-Gitaxias 's research on kami in Kamigawa , New Phyrexia has learned how to compleat a planeswalker without removing their soul, which they put into practice by compleating Tamiyo . Tamiyo had only been the first to undergo Jin-Gitaxias's special compleation process, enriching her with glistening oil while retaining the powers of her spark. Buoyed by that breakthrough, the master of the Progress Engine eagerly subjected captive Planeswalkers like Ajani Goldmane to ever more effective \u2014 and painful \u2014 procedures. Tezzeret is protected from the influence of the glistening oil thanks to an inoculation furnished by Nicol Bolas . Normally, phyresis is irreversible due to the sheer changes made to the body and mind. However, Karn , Kaya , Koth , Melira and Teferi Akosa used a specialized ritual to un-compleat and fully restore Ajani and Nissa Revane . First, Karn, Koth, and the Zhalfirin healers removed most of the Phyrexian metal from Nissa's body, though it was too integrated into Ajani's to remove. Teferi slowed time to allow the team to work quickly. Melira next inoculated their bodies against further infection. Then, Karn pulled their sparks out and use Venser's spark as a filter, based on a theory of Venser's before his death. The sparks were then cleaned by Melira and returned to their hosts' bodies by Karn, with the help of Kaya's ghostform. The process was so taxing as to kill Melira and cost Karn his spark, but it fully restored both, though Ajani kept his metal enhancements, now purified, and Nissa's spark was damaged prior to or during the process. Nahiri, another planeswalker, was also cured of compleation, though the exact process is unclear. She believed that the cause may have been the voluntary removal of her spark before she received a blast of Halo from the angel Linvala . Another method of eliminating compleation is through lazotep , turning the phyrexian organism into an eternal zombie. Compleation is not to be confused with completion . \"Compleat\" is an archaic spelling of the modern English \"complete\", but it is not a typo. \"Compleated\" and \"Phyrexianized\" are synonyms. Compleated is a keyword ability introduced in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty . According to official lore-master Jay Annelli , compleation in the past was reserved for true Phyrexians. \"They might have grafted metal parts on a useful tool, but they didn't really compleat people who weren't real Phyrexians.\" But, \"nowadays, because it's a contagion, everyone gets compleated.\" Compleation affects its subjects on a microscopic level, fusing the molecules themselves together.
