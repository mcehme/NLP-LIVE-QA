{"text": "Altair of Coloni , also known as the \"White Mage\" was a planeswalker of white magic from the Plains of Coloni on Corondor on Dominaria . He helped build and was a member of the council of mages that gathered in Minorad . When Ravidel appeared at the gathering and threatened them with the Golgothian Sylex , he agreed not to interfere with Ravidel's plans, but Ravidel cast a spell anyway preventing him from using his planeswalker powers.  In 1281 by the Reckoning of the Sages of Minorad , he and Caliphear the Nightmare destroyed the wizard Coldraith , who accidentally removed Ravidel's curse. To repay Caliphear, he agreed to be her slave for ten years. However, he joined Jared Carthalion and Kristina of the Woods in opposing Ravidel and seeking to destroy the Golgothian Sylex only ten months after Coldraith was killed. With Jared, Kristina and Caliphear, Altair battled Ravidel at the Dueling Chasm of Golthonor , and was reportedly killed, having served the nightmare for ten months.
