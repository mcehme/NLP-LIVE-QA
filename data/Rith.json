{"text": "Rith is one of the five Primeval Dragons of Dominaria . Her name means \"childhood\" in the old draconic language, and she is known as \"The Awakener.\" She is the daughter of Palladia-Mors and the sister of Darigaaz . Rith is a magnificent green dragon whose breath causes the rampant growth of lashing vines across whatever it touches. She was imprisoned inside the Magnigoth Treefolk Nemata in Yavimaya by the Numena , but was the first to be freed by Rhammidarigaaz after Tevesh Szat told him of the legend of the Primevals. Once free, she dominated Darigaaz's mind, convincing him to free all of the primevals regardless of the cost to mortal dragon lives. Rith was imprisoned in Urborg when a group of Magnigoth Treefolk awoke and tracked her there. The lead treefolk ripped her out of the sky and swallowed her before returning to Yavimaya. She would later be freed again during the events of the second Phyrexian Invasion, when her psychic connection to her reincarnated brother reawoke her. Her current intentions are unclear, but she and the rest of the freed Primevals could pose a threat to Dominaria once more. Associated cards: Depicted in:"}
