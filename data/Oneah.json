{"text": "Oneah is a country on an island in the Domains of Dominaria , east from the  continent of Aerona . It lies north of Shanodin and south of Amjad , both on the same island. The Oneahn Empire once was one of the most enlightened societies. Though famous for their martial arts, the Oneahns viewed the ownership of a bladed weapon as strictly taboo. The whole country was destroyed by hordes of goblins from the Red Mountains around 4165 AR . To the knowledge of the woman named Ayesh ni hata Kan , only she survived from the whole nation. Oneah contained seven main cities, called the Cities of the Sun (only six are known ): Xa-On Onnirah Onlish Onmarakhent Onnila Oneah City. The capital. A beautiful city. The Great Library The Roof of Lights. The main temple. It is unclear if Oneah was active during the Phyrexian Invasion , since when Sisay and Tahngarth visited the city just a few years before the Invasion, Oneah was abandoned for thirty years. Onean scholars, clerics and soldiers are noted for their wisdom, and often quoted."}
