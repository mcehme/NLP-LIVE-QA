{"text": "Esika is the green -aligned god of the World Tree from Kaldheim . The quiet and humble Esika understands the World Tree and the Cosmos better than anyone, even Alrund . Her deep connection to the World Tree lets her communicate with the Cosmos in ways that she is just beginning to understand; ways that confound even the other gods . What's more, she has walked every realm and knows how each forest connects to the World Tree. She provides the other gods with her Cosmos Elixir , made from the sap of the World Tree, which provides the other gods with their immortality, power, and divinity. She is the only one who knows how to make the elixir, and she's not planning on sharing her secret with anyone. Esika and her sister Tergrid came into being when Alrund used runic magic in an effort to commune with the World Tree . When Vorinclex came to Kaldheim, he used Tibalt to distract people away from his plans. He found Esika's sanctum and mauled the goddess; dying, she witnessed him taking a tyrite sample and returning to New Phyrexia . On the brink of death, she revived herself using the Cosmos Elixir. The Phyrexian Invasion Tree, grown from that very stolen essence, broke through into the Cosmos on Kaldheim. This intrusion by a corrupted version of the tree disoriented Esika to the point where she lost her sense of the Cosmos and could no longer navigate it. This was critical, as the other gods, embroiled in their own fights against the Phyrexians, were relying on her Cosmos Elixir to bolster their powers and keep them free of corruption. Esika's solution was to reach out to the one mortal she trusted would be able to help her: Inga Rune-Eyes , leader of the Omenseeker clan. With her unique gift of vision, Inga charts safe routes for Esika's chariot through the Cosmos, bringing the god wherever she's needed most. She is based on Idunn , the Norse goddess of apples whose fruits provide the Aesir gods with immortality. The Prismatic Bridge is a reference to the Bifr\u00f6st , the rainbow bridge that reaches between Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the Aesir. Esika may also have a connection with Heimdallr , the god who guards Bifr\u00f6st. Esika's Chariot is a reference to the chariot of the goddess Freyja , who is guided by cats. Being the \"God of the World Tree,\" Esika has a relationship with Odin , since the name of the World Tree Yggdrasil 's name is: Ygg's horse (Ygg is one of Odin's other names).
