{"text": "Algenus Kenrith , known as the Good King , was the High King of the Realm on Eldraine . He was the husband of Queen Linden Kenrith , and the father of Erec , Hazel , Rowan and Will Kenrith . Kenrith was a middle-aged, bearded man with a blond beard and a heartfelt, guileless voice. A modest gold circlet usually crowned his head, hard to see against his golden-blond hair. He was always smiling and was known for his courage, skill, and attractive laugh. He was renowned as a canny fighter, only bested by his wife Linden. Many have noted his sixth sense regarding danger and his peculiarly keen ability to react at speed to changing surroundings. On the other hand, he sometimes had a temper and acted impulsively. He was the only person in the Realm to have earned knighthoods at all five courts. He loved his wife and children and he wasn't a particularly inquisitive or deep-thinking man \u2014 he left that to his wife. The High King's entire purpose for existing is to keep the Wilds in check by expanding the orderly peace of the Realm. As a humble young man from Kenrith , Kenrith had been chosen as one of the two candidates to quest for the high rulership. The Questing Beast had given both Linden and him blessed swords as the mark of its favor, each imbued with the power to bestow life. Kenrith and Linden both quested for years after they had been chosen. Over time, they fell in love, but they weren't always questing together. The Kenrith Family In Linden's absence, Kenrith became enthralled by a witch on the border between the Wilds and the Realm. The witch became pregnant with Rowan and Will and killed the twins for their blood, which she intended to drink to extend her life. A kiss from Linden broke the spell on Kenrith and she gave up her sword's power to restore life to the twins, raising them as her children when she married Kenrith. Unlike his wife, Kenrith completed the High Quest and he was proclaimed the High King of the realm. Almost eighteen years later, Kenrith was abducted by the anarchist Planeswalker Oko and turned into a magnificent stag. His children Rowan and Will Kenrith managed to find him in the Wilds , but couldn't prevent him from being mortally wounded by Oko, masquerading as Queen Ayara , during the Wild Hunt . As there was still life in Kenrith's sword, Linden used it to return him to the world of the living as day broke across Eldraine. Kenrith fought in defense of Eldraine during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse . He and his wife Linden Kenrith were killed by the invaders while defending Castle Ardenvale . After his death, his armies followed him into the afterlife as Spirits . Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
