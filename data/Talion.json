{"text": "Talion , known as \"the Kindly Lord, First and Greatest of the High Fae, Sovereign of the Court, the Liege of Laughter, Finder of the First Yew, and the One True Lord of Eldraine\" is a faerie noble serving as the Fae Lord of the Wilds of Eldraine . The fae duelist Obyra is one of their daughters. Talion is otherworldly, ancient, and fickle. They have piercing, gold-colored eyes and wear black robes, delicately pointed boots, a crown, and carry a hawthorn wand. While they are the ruler of Eldraine's fae, they also consider themselves the protector of all of Eldraine's people. Despite having an austere demeanor, the Kindly Lord is also known for following mysterious whims, journeying to the farthest reaches of Eldraine out of an insatiable curiosity. Talion is based on the the Wicked fairy of Sleeping Beauty . Before the Phyrexian invasion of Eldraine , Talion and their High Fae court returned from a long journey to the edge of the plane. They were forced to join with the witch sisters Agatha , Eriette , and Hylda to create the Wicked Slumber , a curse which now affects their whole world, including Talion's daughter, Obyra . In exchange for helping to cast the Slumber, Talion provided each of the witches with a magical artifact that enhanced their powers: Agatha's Soul Cauldron , Eriette's Tempting Apple , and Hylda's Crown of Winter . After Eriette extended the curse to Eldraine's citizens, they tasked the knight Imodane to kill the three witches. When she was caught by Agatha , Talion handed the task to the half-fae Kellan , promising him information about his fae father . Kellan eventually succeeded in the quest, though he declined his reward.
