{"text": "Cathar Rem Karolus , known as the Blade of the Inquisitors , the Slayer of Angels , the Slayer of Eldrazi and the Fiend Slayer , is the most feared and revered of the Thraben inquisitors on Innistrad . A beardless man in his late 30s, inquisitor Karolus usually wears a red cape, brown leather clothes, a trademark rapier at his side, and a large bastard sword across his back. Like all inquisitors from the Church of Avacyn , he can be hired out to come to help a parish if they have a particular problem with vampires , devils or other fiends. Karolus can come across as arrogant and full of bravado. He describes himself as having the brawn and bravery, but not the brains. He is impatient and quick to attack. Karolus does not wish for a glorious end in battle, he very much enjoys living. After all, the longer he lives, the more fights he gets to have. He's just looking for a little challenge. The Elgaud Grounds courted Karolus as an instructor more than once, but he had no interest. He took orders from Thraben when he agreed with their goals, but he often simply wandered around on his dappled gray horse, dealing with crises as he encountered them, and Stensia had at least as many crises as other provinces. After Avacyn 's death, he brought her spear to Thalia and the Order of Saint Traft . After being unable to reach the massive, floating Emrakul , Karolus tamed the largest wild gryff he could find. The skies are now no longer safe from Rem Karolus. At Lambholt Karolus and the astronomer Vadrik were employed to find a farmer named Arinos who had disappeared three weeks back after arguing with the richest man in Lambholt, a pious man named Dein Salvasi . Malynn , one of the elders, believed Old Stickfingers to be involved. Vadrik, Rem and Malynn proceeded to find Old Stickfingers and, after they found it, engaged it in battle and wounded it. The next morning, the three met the daughter of Arinos. Ariosa revealed that Salvasi had threatened to take Arinos' lands. They went to find Salvasi but found his house deserted and discovered that it was Arinos who had summoned Old Stickfingers to kill Salvasi. After employing a ritual to banish Old Stickfingers, Vadrik and Rem parted on good terms. During New Phyrexia's invasion of Innistrad , Rem teamed up with Saint Traft to protect the plane.
