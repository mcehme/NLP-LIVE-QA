{"text": "Troyan is a Vedalken from Ravnica who currently resides on Eldraine . Troyan is blue-skinned and dashing. He wears a green and blue coat with a creature with multiple arms painted on it. He is a self-styled expert climber, professional wanderer, and adventurer. Troyan is based on Jack of Jack and the Beanstalk . Troyan was a member of the Simic Combine on Ravnica. He found his opportunities in the guild limited and unfulfilling. He wasn't a brilliant scientist and was unwilling to become a test subject. His skills were in athletic pursuits, and he often climbed the city's spires, winning every competition he could find. After New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , he took the opportunity afforded by the Omenpaths to travel to Eldraine and become an adventurer. He later guided Kellan and Ruby up a beanstalk to Stormkeld castle. Though not a planeswalker, Troyan travels through the Multiverse through Omenpaths. Ravnica Eldraine Depicted in: Quoted or referred to: Troyan was not in the initial story outline for Wilds of Eldraine . He was developed when Kellan's role in the Omenpath Arc was expanded and he could no longer be used as Jack in the Jack and the Beanstalk tale."}
