{"text": "Hierophant Mavren Fein , is a high-ranking member of the Legion of Dusk , of Torrezon 's clergy on Ixalan . Fein speaks both his native tongue as well as the language of the Sun Empire . A powerful man, his voice rings with unshakable authority that makes nobles tremble. Fein seeks Elenda , the guardian of the Immortal Sun , to bring eternal life to his people. After the theft of the Immortal Sun , Elenda had become a vampire and taught her Rite to the nobles so that they could take up the sacrifice and join her in her search. Mavren Fein was one of her early converts, taking the rite two hundred years before the race for Orazca . He watched as she sailed back into the west and waited for his day to follow her. Centuries later, he finally traveled to the continent of Ixalan, to find Orazca and the Immortal Sun. He guided his ship to shore by faith alone when he destroyed the navigational instruments during the rapture of his Blood Fast . On his own, he managed to reach Adanto . Joining up with Vona , the Butcher of Magan, he managed to reach Orazca and threw Kumena out of the window of the Tower of Triumph. After the vampires, came Huatli and her Sun Empire compatriots, Angrath and his pirate crew, and the unlikely couple of Vraska and Jace . While the four factions struggled to claim the sun's power for themselves, the artifact was stolen by Tezzeret and removed from the plane. After the Immortal Sun was stolen from the plane, Saint Elenda reappeared and told her followers that they were finally free from their ancient duty. An angry and confused Vona asked her why she had left them and denied them immortality. Elenda answered that immortality was not the purpose of her gift, but protection. Deference to forces greater than themselves and humility would lead them to salvation, not the Immortal Sun. She told that she had found the sun and decided to become its sentinel within the Golden City while awaiting the arrival of other members of her order. She asked to be brought to Queen Miralda. Vona denied her, but Mavren Fein punished Vona for speaking ill of the living saint. After reprimanding Vona, the three left and the Legion left the continent of Ixalan. Fein later returned from Torrezon to the continent of Ixalan and was captured by the Sun Empire. When New Phyrexia invaded Ixalan , he was released under Huatli 's command to invoke the Elder Dinosaurs against the invasion. After being summoned, the elder dinosaur Ghalta cut loose among the remaining Phyrexian ranks. Seeing an opportunity, Mavren commanded his legionnaires to follow in the elder dinosaur's wake. Any Phyrexians that managed to dodge or survive Ghalta's rampage found themselves set upon by vicious vampire conquistadors. Casualties ran high, but by taking advantage of the chaos left in Ghalta's wake, Mavren was able to deal some serious damage to the invaders. Quoted or referred to:"}
