{"text": "The Cathedral of Serra is a Dominarian temple built in honor of the planeswalker Serra on the Plains of Sursi . It was built by Brother Angus and completed and dedicated on his seventieth birthday to Serra, whom he saved \u2013 momentarily \u2013 from a planeswalker assailant. Serra blessed the land with her passing, flooding it with holy power to be a sanctuary against the dark forces that assailed her followers. Because of this, Serra Angels sometimes spontaneously appear in the Cathedral to this day. It is one of the sacred sites of the Church of Serra . Refugees from Serra's Realm created floating buildings above it, reminiscent of their home plane."}
