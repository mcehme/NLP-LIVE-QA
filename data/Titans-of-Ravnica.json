{"text": "The Titans are gigantic stone statues that can be animated by the Boros Legion to defend Ravnica . There is one for each district of the city, but only one was named. However, during the decamillennial one of the statues was destroyed by the quietmen and since then the Boros have been unable to activate them. It is unknown why this is. It could be that the destruction of one of them deactivated the magical field in all of them, or that they were actually powered by the Guildpact , which was broken during the decamillennial. Zobor is the Titan of the Tenth District , guarding the Rokiric Pavilion and the Centerfort ."}
