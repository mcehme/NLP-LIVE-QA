{"text": "The Ice Rime Hills are a region in North Aerona , east of the Sea of Fire , south of Keld and the Rip , and west of the Whispering Woods . The hills are grassy, with pockets of hardwood trees that shelter mule deer, goats and stunted bison. Farther west lies a port city called Concord , which was visited by Towser 's entourage, and a large seaport called Oyster Bay . The buildings and streets of Oyster Bay are carved into white chalk cliffs. The Ice Rime Hills contained sacred sites of Keld. Control over the region was contested between Keld and Benalia . A summit to settle their dispute was held at Oyster Bay in In 4561 AR ."}
