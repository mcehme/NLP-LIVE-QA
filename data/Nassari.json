{"text": "Dean Nassari is a efreet shaman teacher at the Prismari College of Strixhaven University on Arcavios . They were compleated during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse . Dean Nassari of Prismari always wants to see art that is bigger, more radical in concept, and more emotionally impactful. For their final project as a mage-student, Nassari famously once \"turned in\" an earthquake that almost destroyed three campus buildings. The piece received a standing ovation from the mage-student body and a grumpy thumbs down from the campus construction golems . Nassari knows that true expression comes from the heart. They encourage their students to treat the entire world as their canvas, spreading emotion and excitement in their wake. Nassari takes little heed of Uvilda 's quiet masterpieces, in fact, they often forget Uvilda works there at all. Nassari was important to Rootha Squallheart , helping the orc to express her unique magic. It was this bond that distracted Rootha from the Invocation of the Founders during Phyrexia's attack on Strixhaven. The dean, who now appeared as a giant mechanical heart, had been compleated earlier in the invasion. Once Quintorius Kand completed the spell, Nassari was thrown from the rooftop. Though many compleated professors were killed, Nassari was inexplicably uncompleated. Quoted or referred to:"}
