{"text": "Cobra -headed Rhonas was the Amonkhet god of strength, both in physical superiority and mental aspects of willpower. The ability to resist fear, to face any battle with an indomitable will and self-reliance are the qualities that ensure success in Rhonas's trial, which was the third trial. To Rhonas, strength was all. Strength encompasses physical forcefulness, speed, endurance, mental reflexes, willpower, and determination. He believed he had obtained perfect strength. Without hesitation, he rushed into battle to protect the city and its people from desert horrors, wielding his powerful weapon and venomous fangs. In the Hour of Glory , The Scorpion God fought and killed Rhonas. Rhonas was zombified . During the War of the Spark on Ravnica , he reappeared as a God-Eternal in Bolas's army. He was destroyed by Gideon and his Blackblade . Rhonas' snake-like appearance is similar to Wadjet , an Egyptian goddess that often takes the form of a snake. Wadjet was a protective goddess of kings and childbirth. Rhonas could also have drawn inspiration from Renenutet , another Egyptian snake goddess who is often considered another form of Wadjet. Renenutet is the god of the harvest and sustenance, which parallels his position as the green god of strength. Rhonas also has parallels to Mehen , a snake-god responsible for protecting the god Ra during his nocturnal journey through the underworld. Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
