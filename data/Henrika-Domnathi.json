{"text": "Henrika Domnathi is the progenitor of the minor Domnathi vampire bloodline on Innistrad . She is the rumored one-time lover of Griselbrand . Henrika is a very tall, very thin woman, usually clad in a cascading gown. She is a noted demon sympathizer, and admits to feed on demon blood. She can transform into a gray mist. The Domnathi bloodline has always been know to bargain with demons, exchanging favors for the demons' powerful blood. The major bloodlines consider the Domnathi's potent magic dangerous even for vampire-kind, and in ancient times, the Domnathi were subject to many great purges. Henrika leads the survivors to this day and keeps a list of names written in vengeful crimson next to her heart. After the beginning of the The Travails , Henrika hadn't felt bound by the pact that Olivia Voldaren had made with the humans. For Ormendahl , she tried to raise an army of unholy cathars and subverted Commander Odric into a vampire. After the Travails, Olivia Voldaren took an interest in Domnathi magic and even invited Henrika to her wedding in an effort to smooth things over. At the wedding of Olivia and Edgar Markov , Henrika killed Relio Voldaren because he offended her. Depicted in:"}
