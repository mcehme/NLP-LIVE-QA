{"text": "Aetherborn is a black -aligned creature type introduced in Kaladesh , used for cards that depict humanoid creatures made from aether . Some Aetherborn can draw life essence from other beings into themselves to prolong their existence; these have the sub-type vampire . \"Families\" of Aetherborn lay territorial claim to areas where young Aetherborn have manifested and instruct them in the way of their kind. Their bodies are in constant flux as the aether residue they're made of gradually dissolves and is reclaimed by the aethersphere. Thus, their lives are short - they are born fully formed and know their remaining lifespan, which can be between four weeks and four years. But rather than despair, they savor each fleeting moment, squeezing out every last drop of enjoyment. Traditionally, before an Aetherborn dies, they throw a party with mandatory attendance for their friends and associates. Aetherborn that lack such social connections usually hijack the party of another of their kind. Aetherborn do not sleep or eat. Instead, they focus fully on experiencing existence. All Aetherborn have an innate sixth sense that allows them to accurately sense the emotional state of beings in a nearby perimeter. Aetherborn's skin has the look and feel of smooth chalk. Aetherborn have no genders and are referred to using they/them pronouns, though there are cases of individual aetherborn that adopted a gender and associated pronouns. Aetherborn spontaneously came into being on Kaladesh as a byproduct of the aether refinement process. Initially, inventors persecuted the earliest Aetherborn, seeing them as \"mistakes\". Gonti , a crime lord. Rajul , a great inventor. Ranbir , a great inventor. Yahenni , an investor, philanthropist, socialite, and renegade."}
