{"text": "Ravnica (pronounced / RAV -nih-kuh / IPA: /\u02c8\u0279\u00e6v.n\u026a.k\u0259/) is a plane whose main planet is covered in a large city, eponymously known as Ravnica. It takes its flavor from that of Eastern Europe and Slavic folklore, most notably 15th-century Prague. Ravnica is the setting of the Ravnica block , Return to Ravnica block and Guilds of Ravnica , Ravnica Allegiance , and War of the Spark expansions. Ravnica is a worldwide cityscape; an ecumenopolis consisting of a patchwork of grand halls, decrepit slums, and ancient ruins, with layer upon layer of stonework. It is one of the most densely populated planes in the Multiverse. Law magic and the metaphysics of hierarchy are deeply woven into the very fabric of the plane, enabling cooperating leaders to achieve feats of greatness. Of the world's countless civic centers, one looms large above all others: the City of Ravnica , a metropolis so vast that its name has long since become synonymous with the entire plane. Centuries of Ravnican business\u2014powered in many cases by Izzet boilerworks and other guilds\u2019 foundries\u2014have saturated Ravnica's atmosphere with all manner of industrial pollution. Prior to the events of Dissension , the city and plane of Ravnica had been ruled by the Ravnican guilds and governed by the Guildpact for more than ten millennia. While much of its surface is urbanized, subterranean oceans exist. As a plane, Ravnica was affected by the Rift Crisis on Nexus of the Multiverse , Dominaria . As a consequence, it became isolated from the rest of the Multiverse , in a seal similar to the Shard of the Twelve Worlds , but with Ravnica as the only plane. On the surface of this 'micro-shard' appeared a blister, a piece of folded aether that trapped all Ravnican souls upon death, forcing them to become spirits and ghosts that manifested themselves on Ravnica's physical plane as the Ghost Quarter of Agyrem . The separation might also have improved the lifespan of its inhabitants; for example, Agrus Kos was a normal human , who was over 120 years old, an age likely roughly equivalent to 65\u201370 years on Earth. After the Mending the Ravnican ghost-world anomaly was dissolved, and the trapped spirits were able to pass on to the aether. For millennia, cities covered the plane's surface, until eventually they ran together into one vast megalopolis. A delicate and sophisticated race of elves known as the Erstwhile once were an important faction in Ravnica. They were laid to rest in coffins in Umerilek, Mausoleum of the Erstwhile. They returned as Zombie Attendants of Vraska . Their leader is Storrev . Izzet Steam Maze Undercity Reaches Almost ten thousand years before the events of Ravnica , the plane of Ravnica boasted untold violence and brutality, with various factions constantly waging centuries-long war against each other. Realizing that this neverending war would ultimately destroy everything, a council between ten factions was held, where the leader Azor I suggested establishing a living, breathing enchantment that would end the violence and ensure the survival of the factions. While some of the order-phobic factions had initial disagreements, the other nine leaders eventually concurred that such a pact was the best chance of survival. Each of the ten factions signed the Guildpact , and over time, these factions became the ten guilds of Ravnica . The power of the Guildpact was subtle; it prevented any guild from dabbling into the business of any other guild or disturbing the stable power balance among the ten by twisting circumstance and coincidence to nullify the disruptive guild's actions. While the Guildpact was credited with bringing relative peace and prosperity to the plane, sporadic clashes between guilds still occurred. Despite any conflicts between the guilds at a particular time though, the anniversary of the Guildpact's signing was celebrated every year with a day-long festival, where all the people laid down their weapons and made merry. This celebration was called The Festival of the Guildpact. Not all of Ravnica's citizens are a member of a guild; about half of the population is guildless . However, the guilds are a required part of daily life, and their presence is felt everywhere on Ravnica. During the Decamillennial Celebration of 10,000 ZC , the Guildpact was broken. The ancient balance was shattered, and Ravnica was thrown into chaos. In the novel Agents of Artifice , it came to pass that the guilds were officially disbanded. Many of the guilds were forcefully torn down due to the long-simmering unrest the guildless held towards their masters. There were, however, remainders of the guilds present. The former guilds, however, were not long to rest, and they reestablished, many under new leadership. Some adopted a new purpose, as the original Guildpact had bound them to a specific task for over ten thousand years, and the guildless had grown weary of some of their morally questionable activities. Most guilds, however, follow the same basic structure they always had, as habit and traditions are forces at least as strong as the Guildpact. In 10,075 ZC, the Izzet guildmaster discovered that Azor I had created a contingency plan that would take effect if the magic of the Guildpact was ever broken. An intricate network of leylines sprawled across the districts Ravnica called the Implicit Maze , offered a test to the guilds. If they would cooperate to solve the maze, they would secure the power of a new Guildpact. That power was eventually bestowed upon Jace Beleren , who became the Living Guildpact. Any law that he verbally confirms becomes legally binding. As Jace is a planeswalker , his attention never remains focused on Ravnica for long. During his absences, the guilds return to their old habits of fighting with each other over the smallest scraps of influence or territory. Meanwhile an outside influence has taken control over several guilds, for reasons yet unknown. After Niv-Mizzet reveals his knowledge of the existence of other planes , planeswalkers, and the threat of Nicol Bolas, he has Ral Zarek turn Project Lightning Bug into a beacon to call other planeswalkers to help fight Bolas. Ral 's efforts to convince the Ravnican guilds to cooperate with Niv-Mizzet's plan were met with resistance from every quarter. Even bringing them together for a single meeting seemed next to impossible. Every guild had some members who supported cooperation and others who opposed it. At last, a guild summit was convened at New Prahv to discuss the growing tensions between the guilds. Isperia proposed a radical idea: cooperation. After a contentious discussion, Niv-Mizzet arrived to reveal the real threat they were facing. The Firemind then proposed to implement the \"fail-safe\" and grant him the power of the Living Guildpact . Although Niv offered to leave the Izzet League and become a guardian of Ravnica, many distrusted his motives. With that, the summit was adjourned until the following morning. That night, Vraska met Isperia alone in the conference chamber. Simultaneously fulfilling Bolas's demands and achieving personal revenge, Vraska petrified the sphinx. In the morning, the guildleaders reconvened, only to find Isperia turned to stone. All hopes for cooperation now seemed shattered. Not long after, Ral Zarek activated the Interplanar Beacon and at the same time Nicol Bolas arrived on the plane. Main article: War of the Spark (event) As the precarious accord among the guilds teetered on the brink of collapse, Domri Rade led the Gruul in a concerted effort to tip the world into chaos. He amassed an enormous mob to rampage through the city streets, making sure that every guild suffered painful losses to keep them at each other's throats. Some members among the Gruul, especially among the Zhur-Taa clan, thought this to be the End-Raze . The fight between Nicol Bolas and the Gatewatch turns into an all-out planeswalker war. Dozens of powerful planeswalkers , from many disparate realities, unite against the elder dragon , who has claimed dominion over Ravnica and is perilously close to completing the spell that will grant him godhood . As they fight alongside the Gatewatch \u2014led by Chandra Nalaar , Jace Beleren , and Gideon Jura \u2014against Bolas and his relentless army of Eternals , nothing less than the fate of the multiverse is at stake. Little do the Gatewatch suspect that Bolas has not only accounted for their interference, but he is practically relying on it. Bolas arrives and attacks the cityplane, leading to the death of Niv-Mizzet, as well as creating a citadel and a statue of himself. As a reaction, Ral Zarek activates the Interplanar Beacon to call other planeswalkers to Ravnica. Dovin Baan later activates the Immortal Sun to trap the planeswalkers as Bolas unleashes his army of Eternals to conquer the plane and harvest the planeswalkers' sparks. Heavy damage is done to the city, including the destruction of the Vitu-Ghazi and the Chamber of the Guildpact, with much loss of life, both from citizens and planeswalkers. In the end, Bolas was defeated and a resurrected Niv-Mizzet became the new Living Guildpact. During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Vraska led the Phyrexian invasion force against her home plane, first directing Realmbreaker toward the Azorius Senate's guild hall, New Prahv , and the jail in which she once was imprisoned. As vengeance for her fellow gorgons whose eyes were removed, she ordered for Ravnicans to be blinded, letting them scrabble upon the glistening-oil-slicked streets. The Golgari were the primary converted force, with the Simic and Izzet foolishly examining the oil. Parts of the Undercity were raised into its streets, exposed to sunlight for the first time in centuries. Various planeswalkers, notably Teyo Verada and Ral Zarek , helped to repel the invasion, with Zarek able to defeat Vraska and her forces with a sonic weapon attuned against the oil. Bolstered by the power of the Guildpact through the Guildpact Paragons, the guilds and their leaders also fought to defend Ravnica. In the invasion\u2019s destructive wake, Ravnica's balance of power saw a massive shift. Though the Firemind reaffirmed his position as Ravnica\u2019s supreme authority and protector, the Golgari were almost totally compleated, the Dimir are rumored to be gone, and distrust of the Simic and Izzet are at an all-time-high. Main article: Ravnican guild The Azorius Senate ( ) is the police force, legislative and judicial body of Ravnican bureaucracy. The Boros Legion ( ) is a standing army that protects the Guildpact and contains the League of Wojek , the official peacekeepers of the City of Ravnica. House Dimir ( ) was recently thought extinct, and provides illegal but necessary services, while openly serving as couriers, investigators, reporters, and archivists. The Cult of Rakdos ( ), considered a necessary evil by some, is composed of thrill-killers who provide the heavy labor force, catering, and entertainment of the plane. The Golgari Swarm ( ) manages food production and organic waste disposal. The Gruul Clans ( ) have fallen from their former glory as the keepers of Ravnica's wilds and now are nothing but a loose affiliation of berserker clans who seek to wipe civilization from the plane. The Izzet League ( ) is responsible for the world-city's civil engineering works and new magical developments. The Orzhov Syndicate ( ) was originally the most widespread religion of Ravnica. Now it regulates trade and banking, among other activities such as law. The Selesnya Conclave ( ) promotes what is now the strongest, nature-based religion of Ravnica and its ledev guards patrol the rural areas along with being conservationists and charity workers. The Simic Combine ( ) provides medical assistance and performs biological research. The original City of Ravnica was made up of 10 districts, named in simple numerical order. No correlation exists between the ten guilds and the ten districts, all guilds are active in every district. The Tenth District, in particular, is a hotbed of activity where all the guilds maintain their primary headquarters. Beyond the core are countless other districts that originated as outlying cities that eventually melded into the expanding metropolis. Examples are Irbitov and Jezeru . Among other constellations in Ravnica's sky is Qeeto, the Cat-Thief. The ten districts are arranged radially around the center of Ravnica. The Center of Ravnica is the hub of the great city and the entire plane. One of the only exposed areas of Ravnica's original surface of any significant size. This site is actually the top of a mountain. At the street level, it is a flat, solid ground where many important halls and monuments are located. Consists of fashionable and elegant streets. Contains overgrown areas with dank bogs. Former Azorius territory, but lost after the Guildpact broke. Recently claimed by the Boros from the Gruul and Rakdos with the aid of Gideon Jura .

Titan's Keg Tavern , rebuilt, often frequented by giants . Old Rav , older and deeper parts of Ravnica. Realm of the Golgari. Rozlad Square The First Vineyard , claims to be the oldest tavern on Ravnica. The Tenth is the hub of most important activity on Ravnica, and this is reflected in grander architecture, busier markets, and wilder traffic in the streets. To be governed effectively, the Tenth District is broken into six precincts, each the size of a small city. Precinct One (also known as the Guildpact Precinct ) is the hub of the wealthy and powerful and Precinct Two is populated by businesses. In Precinct Three (the Greenbelt ), nature has encroached on the urban environment, while the scarred streets of Precinct Four are a proving ground for soldiers and marauders alike. Precinct Five is characterized by its many schools, libraries, and laboratories, and Precinct Six is the workers' district with warehouses, docks, and factories. Two major avenues and one alley run across the whole Tenth District, crossing precinct lines: The Transguild Promenade . Lined with markets and parks. Tin Street , a vital center of trade and a popular spot for restaurants and theaters. At some points, it is possible to look down Tin Street and see Vitu-Ghazi . Tin Street Market . A favorite of Vraska . Gnat Alley , Ravnica's longest continuous street. A tunnel-like alley that serves as one of the Gruul's most trusted methods of navigating through Ravnica's posh neighborhoods.

An Orzhov coin Ravnica's primary currency are coins referred to as zibs and zinos, with 100 zibs making up 1 zino. A denomination called \"zidos\" has also been referenced, although it carries an equal value to zinos and may be a typo or nickname for the silver variant of the currency. The same is true for a denomination called \"zigs\" and the similarly named zibs. Coinage is regulated by Ravnica's guilds, with the Azorius, Boros, and Orzhov operating its primary mints. The card Conjured Currency depicts gold coins bearing the Dimir symbol, but it is unclear if these are meant to mimic existing coinage. While real zinos can be made of silver or gold, counterfits are often made of tin. A coin bearing Lazav 's likeness is given to those elevated to Dimir remainder. 24 generations before 10,075 Z.C., the Izzet invented a machine that could turn copper coins into gold. The known denominations include: Boros legionnaires are paid one Boros-minted gold zino per week, while officers are paid with a gold 5-zino coin. A warehouse worker loading heavy cargo might make one zino in a single day, while a professional thief could make 100. Based on tithing records, the average salary of the richest 95% of citizens in the Orzhov neighborhoods of Clover Heights, Prosperity Estates, and Oligarch's Row was well over 520 zinos per week in 10,075 Z.C. Orzhov fines can be paid at a rate of two zibs per labor hour. The Izzet goblin Observer Kaluzax had a life savings of 5,732 zinos. The exact value of Ravnican coinage is unclear, but the prices of various items are known: The board game Clans & Legions is popular across the plane. It appears to be similar to Chess , although played on a six-by-six board. Pieces include the soldier , skyknight, cleric , and angel , likely analogous to the pawn , knight , bishop , and queen . Black goes first, and taken pieces are claimed in the attacker's boneyard. One of the most famous plays is Razia's Folly, the only three-move win, equivalent to the Fool's Mate . Once a player clears a board, they declare victory by stating \"You're nullified.\" Another board game, simply called \"Guilds,\" is also popular. Ravnica means \"plain\" in Serbo-Croatian coming from the word ravan , meaning flat, level, plane. It's pronounced \"rahv-NEE-cah\" even though \"rahv-NEE-tsah\" would be the more precise pronunciation since Wizards uses the same phonetics each time in order to avoid spelling issues. According to legend, the City of Ravnica (the central metropolis) had been meticulously designed with Izzet precision after the signing of the Guildpact as a gift to the other guilds.\u00a0The city had also been a secret offering to Niv-Mizzet that would have created a city-sized power sigil giving the Magewrights ultimate control over the plane. Izzet goblins supposedly fumbled the design just enough to prevent the sigil from working as intended. \"Zonots\" are based on cenotes , natural water-filled pits found in Mexico. The spelling of the word was changed to use Eastern European phonemes.
