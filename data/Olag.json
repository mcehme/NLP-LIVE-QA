{"text": "Olag , Ludevic's Hubris, is a zombie from Innistrad . The necro-alchemist Ludevic had grown ill. Obsessed with making his \"final creation,\" Ludevic returned to the lab. He combined flesh, metal, and pieces from four different brains into a body unlike any Innistrad had ever seen (which is impressive considering the Eldrazi were just here). Calling his creation \"Olag,\" Ludevic activated his machines and breathed life into the creature . Cackling madly, Ludevic ordered Olag to go out into the world and maim, kill, and destroy. \"But why?\" asked Olag, their voice mellifluous and innocent. Ludevic was disgusted. He did not create this creature to be kind. Olag remains locked away beneath the laboratory until Ludevic figures out how to fix them. Although locked away, Olag is not alone. They have been receiving visits from a mysterious figure who has promised them their freedom very, very soon. Associated cards:"}
