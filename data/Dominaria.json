{"text": "Dominaria Card comparisons Trivia Planeswalker decks Dominaria is the 78th Magic expansion. It was released on April 27, 2018. It is not part of a block . Dominaria is the first set to follow the Three-and-One Model , which abolished blocks . Richard Garfield was on the design team, for the first time since the original Innistrad set. It contains 269 cards (20 basic lands, 101 commons, 80 uncommons, 53 rares, 15 mythic rares), and includes randomly inserted premium versions of all cards. Ten additional cards are found in the set's planeswalker decks (2 mythic planeswalkers, 2 rares, 2 uncommons, 2 commons, and 2 common dual lands). These are numbered #270/269 to #279/269. A unique Buy-a-Box promotional card numbered #280/269 is also considered to be part of the set. Nostalgia and legendary creatures are major themes. Each booster contains at least one legendary creature, though this does not apply to the 8-card booster packs on MTG Arena . The expansion symbol depicts a Benalish shield. Because of its similarity to the Darksteel symbol, the common version has an inverted color scheme (more white than black). As a gimmick, all the names of sets taking place on Dominaria (including Alpha , Beta , Revised , Unlimited and Origins ) or Rath (which was overlaid with Dominaria) are mentioned in card names or flavor text . Five of the basic lands feature a tiny silhouette of the Skyship Weatherlight in their art. Starting with Dominaria , Wizards of the Coast applies a new coating method for cards in English booster packs. A substantial part of the set was accidentally spoiled six weeks before release, when Wizards of the Coast China published the release notes for Dominaria , instead of those for Masters 25 . The expansion code of Dominaria is DOM in the Information below the text box , but DAR seems to be used by Wizards as well. Dominaria booster featuring Jaya Ballard Dominaria Saga card Dominaria is set on the plane of the same name , for the first time since the Time Spiral block (or Magic Origins if sets involving multiple planes are included). Sixty years after the Mending , this world is healing from its wounds. Returning legendary characters are Teferi , Jhoira , Jaya Ballard , and Karn . Dominaria\u2019s story starts right after the events of Hour of Devastation . Gideon and Liliana have arrived on Dominaria following the Gatewatch \u2019s defeat at the hands of Nicol Bolas . Together, they begin a mission to kill Belzenlok , the final demon holding Liliana\u2019s contract. The cards that represent the Story Spotlights in Dominaria are: Broken Bond ; Final Parting ; Settle the Score and In Bolas's Clutches . Main article: Magic Story The \" Planeswalker redirection rule \" is removed. Instead, each relevant card will tell you on the card specifically whether the card dealing direct damage can target planeswalkers . Some older cards will be errata 'd to have \u201cplayer\u201d changed to \u201cplayer or planeswalker\u201d. Others will refer to \"any target\". As of Dominaria , the use of the term \" mana pool \" has been discontinued in the card text. Abilities that pertain to mana production will simply refer to the mana type being produced. As of Dominaria , Magic uses \"they\" as the preferred third-person-singular pronoun for a player, replacing \"he or she\", \"him or her\" or \"his or her.\". Abilities that modify how a spell behaves on the stack , such as additional costs , now refer to themselves as \"this spell\" rather than by using their card name. White Dominaria Theme Booster Dominaria is sold in 16-card boosters (one card being a marketing card ), two planeswalker decks and the Dominaria bundle . The boosters feature artwork from Karn, Scion of Urza , Teshar, Ancestor\u2019s Apostle , Jaya Ballard , Shalai, Voice of Plenty , and artwork of Teferi not used by any card (which was also used in the package in Teferi's planeswalker deck). With the release of Dominaria , Wizards of the Coast began testing a new product at 300 Walmart locations across North America called the \u201cDominaria Theme Booster \u201d. These contain 35 cards (a variable amount of commons and uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare) from a given color or theme. The MSRP is $6.99. By limiting this test to a single large account, WotC hoped to perform a controlled test that allowed them to more efficiently and accurately interpret sales results that would help inform future decisions about this kind of product. Color boosters may contain artifacts, as well. As a test, players in New Zealand were able to get MTG Arena codes inside select Dominaria booster packs, providing Closed Beta access as well as in-game items.

Store Championship : full-art foil Steel Leaf Champion Magic League : foil Zhalfirin Void Buy-a-Box : Firesong and Sunspeaker (collector's number 280/269) As this promo was the only way to obtain this particular card, its release was heavily criticized. A comparison was made with the exclusive release of Nalathni Dragon in 1994 , after which Wizards of the Coast had vouched to make all cards available one way or another for the main public.

There is also a tribal theme for the Wizards , with several cards costing less when you control a Wizard. A minor Knight tribal theme was taken from the never completed second Dominaria set, codenamed Salad . The set debuts legendary sorcery cards that capture extraordinary moments from main characters' pasts. These powerful spells can only be cast while you control a legendary creature or planeswalker . The set sees the return of kicker , a keyword ability that allows the player to pay an extra cost for a bonus effect . Kicker was first featured in the Invasion block and last seen in the Zendikar block . Crew is used for the Weatherlight Vehicle . Dominaria introduces \" Hexproof from [quality]\" as a variant of the hexproof ability. \"Hexproof from black\" means \"This permanent can't be the target of black spells your opponents' control or abilities of black sources your opponents' control.\" It also introduces \" equip [quality] creature\" as a variant on equip. For example, \"equip legendary creature\" means \"this equip activated ability can only target a legendary creature.\" Double is a keyword action formally introduced for Grunn, the Lonely King . Dominaria features the following limited archetypes: : Historic ( Raff Capashen, Ship's Mage ) : Control ( Rona, Disciple of Gix ) : Sacrifice ( Garna, the Bloodflame ) : Kicker ( Hallar, the Firefletcher ) : Tokens ( Shanna, Sisay's Legacy ) : Legendary ( Arvad the Cursed ) : Spellslinging Wizards ( Adeliz, the Cinder Wind ) : Saproling Sacrifice ( Slimefoot, the Stowaway ) : Auras , Equipment ( Tiana, Ship's Caretaker ) : Ramp ( Tatyova, Benthic Druid ) The set introduces a new enchantment subtype : Saga . Each Saga tells the story of a key event from the past as it unfolds during each of the player's turns. As the Saga enters the battlefield and after the player's draw step , that player adds a lore counter , which triggers the appropriate chapter ability . Once all abilities have been triggered (for Sagas introduced in Dominaria , each has exactly three), the Saga is then sacrificed. Saga cards have a special vertically-aligned frame treatment . The rules text with the three chapter abilities is on the left side, and the art is on the right side. Historic is a new game term that refers to a card that has the legendary supertype , the artifact card type, or the Saga enchantment type. Some abilities trigger \"whenever you cast a historic spell.\" Jaya is the newest planeswalker subtype . Returning creature types , typical for Dominaria, are Homarids , Kavu , Thrulls and sapient Apes . Starting with this set, all legendary cards except planeswalkers have a slightly different card frame with crown-like flourishes on the title bar . Reviving a practice used for the Portal sets, a thin separator bar now appears between rules text and flavor text on cards with both to make each more distinct. Starting with this set, FNM promos feature a dark text box with a planeswalker symbol watermark . The collector number lines up with its place in the main set, where it's also being printed. The set introduces Egg counters and Silver counters as new counter types . The set also saw the return of Aim counters . Dominaria has nine cycles : Dominaria has six mirrored pairs . Sage of Lat-Nam , first printed in Antiquities , last seen in Eighth Edition . Skizzik , first printed in Invasion . Thorn Elemental , first printed in Urza's Destiny , last seen in Eighth Edition . Syncopate , first printed in Odyssey , last seen in Return to Ravnica . Aven Sentry is a functional reprint of Assault Griffin from Magic 2011 , except for creature types. Blink of an Eye is a functional reprint of Into the Roil from Zendikar . Cabal Evangel is a functional reprint of Walking Corpse from Innistrad and of Gutter Skulk from Gatecrash , except for creature types. Cold-Water Snapper is a functional reprint of Benthic Giant from Theros , except for creature types. Frenzied Rage is a functional reprint of Giant Spectacle from Kaladesh . Knight of New Benalia is a functional reprint of Blade of the Sixth Pride from Future Sight , Dromoka Warrior from Dragons of Tarkir , Oreskos Swiftclaw from Journey into Nyx , Devilthorn Fox from Shadows over Innistrad , and Raptor Companion from Ixalan , except for creature types. Mesa Unicorn is a functional reprint of Bishop's Soldier from Ixalan , except for creature types. Short Sword is a functional reprint of Leonin Scimitar from Mirrodin and Honed Khopesh from Amonkhet . Tolarian Scholar is a functional reprint of Blind Phantasm from Future Sight and of Jwari Scuttler from Rise of the Eldrazi , except for creature types. Main article: Dominaria/Card comparisons Main article: Dominaria/Planeswalker decks Dominaria features two planeswalker decks : Jhoira, Weatherlight Captain is a blue-red creature that cares about artifacts, fulfilling a popular request by Commander players. Lich's Mastery is an alternate-loss card . Weatherlight is one of the few cards having the same name as an expansion . Now a vehicle , each individual crew member can crew it on their own, except for its stowaway , who can do this with a Saproling token. Mox Amber was nearly the first Mox printed that was able to pass through Standard without significant impact, after Mox Opal, Chrome Mox and Mox Diamond all proved too powerful. Alas, Kethis, the Hidden Hand arriving in Magic 2020 meant that it had a brief seasonal stint as the linchpin of a powerful combo deck that later caused Kethis to be banned in Pioneer as a precaution. Goblin Chainwhirler is an efficient red creature with a mass 1-toughness removal ETB effect. It became a staple for Standard , its triple Red mana cost being so restraining and iconic that the premier deck of the format was known as Chainwhirler Red. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria is a 5-costed blue-white planeswalker with 4 starting loyalty that has every quintessential planeswalker requirement - unconditional card advantage, targeted removal, and a game-ending ultimate - with the cherry on top that the positive loyalty ability untaps two lands, resulting in a net three-mana planeswalker. It proved to be so powerful that it was an automatic staple for control decks during its standard lifespan and continues to see play in UW decks in formats up to Modern. It was often used as the finisher of choice in combination with Approach of the Second Sun from Amonkhet and later in Nexus of Fate decks. Many cards reference past cards and places from past blocks set on Dominaria. Main article: Dominaria/Trivia Mark Rosewater (August 7, 2023). \" Lessons Learned, Part 5 \". magicthegathering.com .
