{"text": "Doomskar. A Doomskar is a collision of the realms of Kaldheim which causes earthquakes, destabilization, and total chaos. With it, inevitably, comes war and chaos. A time of great suffering. Although each realm is distinct, they are all in constant motion around the World Tree , and sometimes they overlap. Such an overlap is called a Doomskar, and it's a violent, explosive event marked by world-altering earthquakes and geological destabilization. Inevitably, the inhabitants of the overlapping realms come into conflict. Being a sapling from the world tree, Realmbreaker can create doomskars across the multiverse, allowing New Phyrexia to invade other worlds. During the Invasion, all ten realms collided with each other, connecting Kaldheim as one plane. A Doomskar is essentially a mini- Ragnar\u00f6k . Associated cards:"}
