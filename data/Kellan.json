{"text": "Kellan is a half- Fae half- Human from Eldraine . He is the son of the faerie Planeswalker Oko . Kellan is wiry and small for his age. He has brown skin and wavy brown hair. He was gifted two magical basket hilts by Talion . The swords ignite with a blade of ethereal light that sharpens like thorns around the hilts and can be used as a makeshift whip. He wears a vibrantly-colored enchanted coat his mother made for him that depicts the story of his parents' meeting. Kellan's mother was a Human woman who trained for five years as a hedgewitch. His father was the young faerie planeswalker Oko . At some point shortly after arriving in Eldraine around 4547 AR , Oko met Kellan's mother in a field of nightshade. Over the next few years, the two met regularly in the same location and shared knowledge of their planes. She left her mistress and began learning magic from Oko, and he promised her a throne. She eventually became pregnant with Kellan. Upset at the villagers' dislike and mistreatment of his lover, Oko lashed out at them, causing her to leave him. She later became a weaver and married the shepherd Ronald . On Oko's return trip around 4561 AR , he reached out to the woman again, but she chose to remain with her son. Kellan grew up as a sheep farmer in a small home in Orrinshire with his mother, stepfather, and family sheepdog Hex . The smallest boy in his village, he was often bullied by local kids, including the sons of Matilda Cotter , for being a \"half-blood\" and blamed as the cause of the Wicked Slumber . At age sixteen, on the night of a new moon six months after New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Kellan was called to Fae Lord Talion 's realm and given the quest of defeating the witch sisters Agatha , Eriette , and Hylda and ending the Wicked Slumber. On his quest, he traveled to Edgewall, where he met Ruby . The two traveled to Dunbarrow, where Kellan hoped to locate a witch, and Ruby hoped to find her brother Peter . They were pursued by the Wolf Knight but were able to escape through a pack of Witchstalkers. Stumbling upon Agatha's cabin, Kellan slayed the witch by pushing her into her cauldron and rescued the captured knight Imodane . After Agatha's death, the enchantment on the Wolf Knight lifted, and he revealed himself to be Peter. Together with his new friends, Kellan presented Talion with the hag's cauldron and was directed up a beanstalk in search of Indrelon . With the vedalken Troyan as their guide, Kellan and Ruby climbed up the beanstalk to Stormkeld. Consulting the mirror, they found Hylda 's ice castle in Loch Larent. Braving the ice, Kellan learned to use his basket hilts while fighting frost warriors, but fell prey to the Wicked Slumber a mile from the castle. Hylda took mercy on the two, reviving Kellan, relinquishing her crown, and informing them that Talion was also responsible for the curse. The two were gifted ponies by Talion and sent to infiltrate Castle Ardenvale to defeat the final witch. Captured by Rowan Kenrith , they were able to escape when Will Kenrith and his knights assaulted the castle. When Ashiok appeared, Kellan helped Will subdue the planeswalker, allowing Will's knights to capture Eriette, though Rowan escaped. Returning to Talion, Kellan declined his reward, choosing to learn his parentage from his mother. He returned to Orrinshire, where she revealed his father's identity as the planeswalker Oko. In search of more answers about his father, Kellan stumbled upon an omenpath . He entered and found himself on the plane of Ixalan . Kellan was originally intended to fulfill the role of Jack of Jack and the Beanstalk , until his role in the Omenpath Arc was expanded and the Jack role was moved to Troyan. Kellan's codename in development was \" Jack \" for this reason. Kellan appears in the official trailer and the anime trailer for Wilds of Eldraine . In his adventures, Kellan has acquired the following items: Two Lightblade basket hilts (gifted by Lord Talion). Agatha's Soul Cauldron (returned to Lord Talion). Eriette's Tempting Apple (returned to Lord Talion). Hylda's Crown of Winter (returned to Lord Talion). Though not a planeswalker, Kellan is able to travel to other worlds through Omenpaths.
