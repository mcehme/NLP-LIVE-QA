{"text": "Abyss is a slang term used by Magic R&D to describe spells that force all players / opponents to sacrifice a creature each turn . This mechanic is primary in black . While not particularly common in modern design, the figurative version comes up commonly in Limited play when one player has a non-evasive creature too large to block profitably, and can attack each turn to force a chump block . It is named after the eponymous The Abyss . In the 2021 Mechanical Pie update, the slang term was replaced by \"Creature sacrifice, forced, repeatable\"."}
