{"text": "Frog is a creature type used for cards that depict tailless, stout-bodied amphibians, including the smooth, moist-skinned frog species that live in a damp or semi-aquatic habitat and the warty, drier-skinned toad species that are mostly terrestrial as adults. They appear in blue , black and green . The first creature to bear the type was Whiptongue Frog in Exodus , though Chub Toad from Ice Age was issued errata to become a frog as well. In the Grand Creature Type Update the subtype Toad ( Morgue Toad ) was incorporated into the Frog class. Burrogs are frog-folk living on the west coast of Orrithia on Arcavios . Anurids are water-dwelling Frog Beasts , native to Otaria . A famous one was Turg . Yargle, Glutton of Urborg was \"born\" when a frog ate a transformed ambitious follower of Belzenlok , whose spirit corrupted it into a hulking monstrosity (that was still a frog). The Gitrog monster is an enormous frog that lives in a lake in the highlands of Nephalia on innistrad . Frogs are more commonly heard than seen in Ixalan , joining their voices to the vivid soundscape of the jungle. They range from tiny poisonous tree frogs found in the branches of tall trees to huge horned frogs that lurk in marshy areas. The Frogmite is one of the few natural enemies of the blinkmoth on Mirrodin . Frogs are a favorite experimental resource for the Simic Combine . The Crocanura is a mutant Crocodile Frog; the Species Gorger is another Frog Beast. Creatures like the Omnibian instead transform their surroundings into frogs. The Trollbred Guardian demonstrates biological fusion into partially-sapient beings. Frog in a Blender was a Standard deck popular after the release of Torment . Frogmite is an Artifact Frog. Anurid Brushhopper is the only -aligned frog. Polymorphist's Jest and Turn to Frog turn creatures into 1/1 blue Frogs until end of turn. A version of Unstable 's Very Cryptic Command also has this ability. Frogify does it permanently. Though Kasmina's Transmutation is similar in effect and the art features a polymorphed frog, the card does not change the target's creature type. The Omnibian (the result of Simic experimentation) turns creatures into 3/3 Frogs until end of turn. Frogs are often used as an Unwilling Ingredient for potions. Kamigawa Akki use frogs as helmets."}
