{"text": "Anhelo was a vampire and the former crime-lord and boss of the Maestros family in New Capenna . He was the best assassin in the city but also an artist. He was compleated during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse and killed by his daughter, Errant . Anhelo saw no difference between a dagger and a paintbrush. He would get any job done and turn the crime scene into a work of art in the process. The man couldn't resist a little creative flourish here and there. Dagger, paintbrush, it was all the same to him. He loved to set a corpse up with a crime scene so pretty, any bystanders wished they had been killed instead. He called it his art, his bit of \"hidden spectacle.\" Maybe he was trying to impress his boss or his darling daughter. Unnecessary, if you asked the average citizen, but vampires are just like that sometimes. Ironically for a vampire, Anhelo disliked people \"who [work] in the dark,\" rather than having their work \"out in the open.\" He had a daughter, Errant , with a now-dead wife named Serena . Despite the ruthlessness with which he approached his work, he was very close to them and tried to be a reliable and affectionate father.  He had pale eyes, fair skin, and slicked-back dark hair that ran close to his head and curled around a high steel collar. Carefully manicured stubble lined his jaw. While assassinating a Nightmare at the request of Evelyn , he received permanent scars along his rib cage. After his compleation, pale plates replaced parts of his body with sharp, unnatural angles and red sinew stretched up his neck. Parts of his flesh had been hollowed out, and there was a void where his heart once was. Anhelo used to be a historian and a businessman all in one. Any business deal or contract with the Maestros or their museum had to go through him. He wouldn't say how he got the job, but that tidbit of knowledge was the family's worst-kept secret. He was Lord Xander's right-hand man before the city was built, and he still was long after. Personally trained by Lord Xander for centuries, Anhelo was one of the best assassins in the city. Three years before the events of Streets of New Capenna , he killed Severo . On the day of Errant's wedding to Parnesse , he killed Fiero Vespin and Severo's son. As the former deacon of Xander , he was promoted after his boss's death during the Cabaretti Crescendo . After Atraxa invaded the plane with her New Phyrexian forces , Anhelo was compleated . He faced his daughter, Errant, trying to stop her from blowing up Park Heights . He failed and died in the explosion. Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
