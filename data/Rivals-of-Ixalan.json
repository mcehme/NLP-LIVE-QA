{"text": "Rivals of Ixalan Card comparisons Planeswalker decks Rivals of Ixalan is the 77th Magic expansion, and the second in the Ixalan block . It was released on January 19, 2018, and is a small expansion . Rivals of Ixalan is the last regular small expansion to be released. The set contains 196 cards (5 basic lands, 70 common, 60 uncommon, 48 rare, and 13 mythic rare) and includes randomly inserted premium versions of all cards. Some of the rares are Double-faced cards which were printed on a separate print sheet . Nine additional cards are found in the set's planeswalker decks (2 mythic planeswalkers, 2 rares, 2 uncommons, 2 commons, and 1 common dual land). These are numbered #197/196 to #205/196. With the exception of the Elder Dinosaur cycle , all the tribes are staying in their same colors from Ixalan . As the design of this set fell between the abandonment of the Two-Block Paradigm , but before the introduction Three-and-One Model , Rivals of Ixalan had a combined Vision / Set Design team instead of separate Design and Development teams. Notably, head designer Mark Rosewater wasn't part of the team. The legendary city of Orazca has been found, but it is not claimed without a fight. The winner will wield the greatest power of the plane . An unexpected rival takes the prize for his master . The cards that represent the Story Spotlights in Ixalan are: Flood of Recollection , Induced Amnesia , and Mastermind's Acquisition . This is the first set to only have three spotlight cards. These feature a Planeswalker symbol icon as a watermark in their text boxes. The icon has no effect on game play. An additional article was published presenting alternate endings (now non-canon) that depicted each faction gaining control of Orazca . Rivals of Ixalan is sold in 16-card boosters (one card being a marketing card ), two planeswalker decks and the Rivals of Ixalan bundle . The boosters feature artwork from Sun Sentinel , Angrath, the Flame-Chained , Riverwise Augur , Frilled Deathspitter , and Moment of Craving .\nThe set doesn't feature a Masterpiece Series . As part of the preview season, Wizards of the Coast again distributed trackable game pieces to stores, fans, volunteers, and some well-known community folk. As game pieces travelled from from geochache to geocache , the distances they travelled  influenced the release of preview cards. By tracking Dinosaurs , Merfolk , Vampires , and Pirates individually, accompanied by votes on social media, it was decided who controlled the golden city at the end of the Rivals of Ixalan story.

There is only one new named mechanic: Ascend \u2014 If you control ten or more permanents , you get the city's blessing for the rest of the game. If you have the city's blessing, you gain a significant advantage depending on the spell you played. A special marker may be used to indicate the city's blessing on the battlefield . This is not a token or emblem , merely a representation of a game state. Both permanents and spells can have ascend. If a spell has ascend, you get the city's blessing as part of the spell's resolution if you control ten or more permanents. If a permanent has ascend, you get the city's blessing immediately once you control ten or more permanents: this is a special action that doesn't use the stack and cannot be responded to.
