{"text": "General Kudro was the stern Commander of the Coppercoats and the military leader of Drannith on Ikoria . He was the father of Jirina Kudro . His wife had died long ago. Kudro was a bald, heavy-set man in his early 60s with a grey mustache. He seemed to be made out of iron and behaved like an automaton beyond human frailties. He wasn't a tall man, but his presence was such that he loomed large in every conversation. His voice was a deep bass rumble, polished smooth from shouting orders across a hundred battlefields. Unlike his daughter, he had an unforgiving approach when it came to bonders and their monsters , believing that the only good monster was a dead monster. He'd use any means necessary to protect Drannith and humanity, although his humanity could be questionable. He disapproved of excessive displays of sentimentality. Kudro refused the help of the crazed bonder Lukka in the defense of Drannith, and killed his flying tiger. In turn, he was murdered by Lukka before the eyes of his daughter.
