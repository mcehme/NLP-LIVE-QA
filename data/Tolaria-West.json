{"text": "Tolaria West is a small artificial island in the Dominarian archipelago of the Spice Isles . Tolaria West was named by scholars of magic who wanted to honor legendary Tolaria . They built the campus of the academy of their own, approximately 300 years after the Phyrexian Invasion , and surrounded it with an artificial body of water to create a small island. It seems to have reached the same fame as its predecessor. The complex has similar white stone buildings and towers as the original Academy. To avoid repeating its predecessor's mistakes, the research of time magic is strictly forbidden. The Academy at Tolaria West is just one of several campuses of the Tolarian Academy. At some point of time, the island had to deal with incursions from the Talas . Sixty years after the Mending , the Academy at Tolaria West was infiltrated by a Cabal agent, who tried to steal a powerful magical device for his master and killed nine students in the process with his dementia magic . He was apprehended by the Weatherlight crew , who were in need of information about the Cabal. During the second phyrexian invasion the Society of Mishra took over Tolaria West. Most of the staff was replaced by Sleeper agents while Geyadrone Dihada replaced the Archmage. At some point after the Time Spiral crisis , Linessa became a member of Tolaria West's academy. The Academy's president is an unknown woman.
