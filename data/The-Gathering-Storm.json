{"text": "The Gathering Storm is a 20 chapter \u2018prequel novel\u2019 to War of the Spark: Ravnica written by Django Wexler . In March 2019, it was revealed at the Emerald City Comic-Con (ECCC) that the prequel novel would become available through the website of publisher Del Rey (part of Random House ) instead of at Magicthegathering.com . The prequel story was released on a weekly basis by way of a newsletter, starting in June 2019. The final chapter was released on October 23, 2019. Although billed as a prequel novel, readers of War of the Spark noted that some essential details were missing from the story of Greg Weisman's novel. Because these events (most notably Niv-Mizzet 's death) were also taken for granted in the depiction of the cards from War of the Spark , it has been speculated that The Gathering Storm was originally intended to be released along with Guilds of Ravnica and Ravnica Allegiance . Wexler's stories are mostly written from Ral Zarek 's point of view, but some sections are written from Vraska 's, Kaya 's, and a Dimir thoughtstealer named Millena 's point of view. Additional characters include Tomik Vrona , Teysa Karlov , Lavinia , and Niv-Mizzet . The Gathering Storm is set during the time period that the Gatewatch is away from Ravnica . The stories featured the new character Hekara , a cheerful Rakdos emissary. The Gathering Storm archive . Random House. Archived from the original on April 9, 2023."}
