{"text": "Zacama , \"all calamity,\" is a three-headed Elder Dinosaur from Ixalan . Zacama's three heads bellow a tri-tonal roar that unleashes a wall of heat and sound powerful enough to disintegrate nearby beings. Each head boasts a mouth full of human-sized, dagger-shaped teeth. The opening of Orazca revealed the enormous elder dinosaurs , which were held in stasis during Orazca's long hibernation in the earth. The three-headed Zacama is a manifestation of white , red , and green mana , a living embodiment of the Threefold Sun . Zacama was tamed and used as a mount by Huatli . During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Zacama was the last of the elder dinosaurs to arrive when summoned to Orazca by Huatli, but was ultimately responsible for vanquishing the compleated Etali , tearing off his arm and head. Dinosaurs are called Quetzacama on Ixalan possibly to be translated as breed of Zacama or serpents of Zacama . Huatli stated that \"speaking with Zacama was engaging with the soul of the plane itself\" . This implies that Zacama may be the Worldsoul of Ixalan . Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
