{"text": "Errant is a human rogue woman, affiliated with the Maestros family in New Capenna . She is the daughter of Anhelo and Serena; and the wife of Parnesse . Errant is a graffiti artist. She has her mother's warm brown skin and her father's thick wavy hair. Errant's and Parnesse's nuptials were targeted by Fiero Vespin , a Maestro assassin and art dealer looking to make a name for himself. Later, after Atraxa attacked the plane during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Errant's father was compleated . Anhelo faced his daughter, trying to stop her from blowing up Park Heights . He failed and died in the explosion. Though she never made her presence known to Errant, Giada was there with her every step of the way, lending extra potency to her halo cartridges and shielding her from the worst of the harm. And it was Giada at the end who ensured Errant was rescued by one of her sisters instead of falling to her death as Park Heights collapsed. It is possible that Magic Story has confused some of Parnesse and Errant's background details, mostly in their familial connections, both in blood and affiliation. . On her card in the SNC set, Errant is presented as a human street artist, seemingly not directly affiliated with any crime family (no watermark) but shown in her art making graffiti which appears to be the Maestro insignia ( Errant, Street Artist ). Jay Annelli , the loremaster consultant, although not speaking for Wizards, confirmed that Errant is Anhelo's child as far as the existing lore is concerned, but notes how that works (i.e. how does a supposedly centuries-old vampire have a living human daughter?) is not clear .
