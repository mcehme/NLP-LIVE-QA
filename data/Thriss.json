{"text": "Primus Thriss was a powerful Nantuko druid who became guardian of the Krosan Forest on Dominaria . He convinced Kamahl to abandon his barbarous ways and trained him as a druid. According to legend, Thriss planted the seeds that became the Krosan forest after the Ice Age receded. From the forest's heart, he was able to sense everything that ebbed and flowed within it. He guarded the forest and kept it safe during the Phyrexian Invasion of Dominaria . During the Mirari Saga , he was considered the oldest and wisest of all the Nantuko, and the living soul of the Krosan Forest. Thriss's fate is unknown, but Kamahl speculated that he was mutated along with the rest of Krosa because of the Mirari 's transformative powers."}
