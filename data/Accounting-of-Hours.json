{"text": "The Accounting of Hours is a scripture featured in the flavor text of the Amonkhet block . The text prophecies the coming of the God-Pharaoh . According to the first prophecy, the Gate to the Afterlife would open when the Second Sun sat entirely between the horns on the horizon, revealing the promise of the God-Pharaoh. Notably absent in the texts is the Hour of Devastation . When the Hours began, the events came to pass as foretold, but steeped heavily in irony, rather than what was expected by the citizens of Amonkhet . In the Hour of Revelation , the Gate to the Afterlife opens, revealing the demon Razaketh , who turns the Luxa River to blood. Beyond the Gate was only the desert - representing that their entire way of life was founded on empty promises. In the Hour of Glory , The Scorpion God fights and kills Rhonas , and a swarm of locusts descends on Naktamun . Rhonas, the strongest of the gods, was effectively deemed unworthy - and by extension, all the citizens are unworthy of the God-Pharaoh. In the Hour of Promise , The Locust God 's swarm destroys the Hekma, while The Scorpion God kills Oketra and Kefnet . The Hekma's protection is no longer needed, as the God-Pharaoh has no need for the remaining living citizens of Naktamun. In the Hour of Eternity , Bolas' army of Eternals is revealed and unleashed. The only Worthy are the Eternals, and their only purpose at the God-Pharaoh's side was as an army of living weapons. In the Hour of Devastation , Naktamun is destroyed and the Gatewatch is defeated. In War of the Spark , the Hours were re-created in the Finales cycle, although the colors were different: Finale of Revelation was blue instead of white Finale of Glory was white instead of black Finale of Promise was red instead of green Finale of Eternity was black instead of blue Finale of Devastation was green instead of red"}
