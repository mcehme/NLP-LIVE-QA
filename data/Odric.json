{"text": "Sir Odric is a master tactician who lives on the plane of Innistrad . He lost a son to a werewolf and he was turned into a vampire by Henrika Domnathi . Odric was the commander of the Gavony Riders and a recipient of the Moonsilver Accommodation. Odric is a battlefield man, better suited to combat maneuvers than negotiating the politics of the Avacynian Church . One of his duties as a Church commander was chasing and capturing the mad scientist Ludevic 's Abomination , which had been spotted near Estwald . After the events of the Avacyn restoration that involved the breaking of the Helvault and the Siege of Thraben , he ordered his lieutenant Grete to triple the escort of the transport detachment of the prisoner Gisa Cecani to Thraben . Sir Odric. While investigating the death of the mayor's son in Torbach , supposedly by a werewolf , he found the planeswalker Garruk Wildspeaker , cursed and weakened. Odric, Grete, and their men captured Garruk, but while Odric was determined to kill the planeswalker, Grete begged for Garruk's life in Avacyn's name. Odric then drugged the planeswalker, tied him up, and moved him to Thraben where the Church of Avacyn would decide his fate. After Lunarch Mikaeus died during the Siege of Thraben, and his successor was killed in the early days of Avacyn's madness , the Lunarch Council was established, made up of senior bishops of the church with a few Cathar leaders in advisory positions. As Marshal, Odric showed tremendous initiative in organizing the Lunarch Council to deal with Avacyn's madness. He earned a seat on the council as a representative of the Cathars, without an actual vote on council matters. After the Lunarch Council was exposed to be controlled by the Skirsdag , Odric and Grete fled the Church and joined Thalia as part of the Order of Saint Traft . While Thalia and Grete went to war, Odric remained behind, his spirit broken by his forced betrayal. Odric was turned into a vampire by Henrika Domnathi . After the beginning of the The Travails , Henrika Domnathi hadn't felt bound by the pact that Olivia Voldaren had made with the humans. For Ormendahl , she tried to raise an army of unholy cathars and subverted them into vampires . While battling Henrika's followers alongside Thalia, they were bested and forced to witness a ritual that would bring Ormendahl to the material plane once more. However, he interrupted the ritual by throwing himself before a blade meant for his ally, saving her but dooming himself. His weakened form was then bitten by Henrika, who found his blood to be like holy water, her immediate spawn boiling inside out and exploding. During the confusion, Thalia wounded the vampire, and Odric forced her to flee. Confused and terrified by his new form, he looked to Thalia and found he was unlike the others of his ilk. The moon did not harm him, instead, it brought him peace, and his enchanted sword still shone brightly in his hand, although the angel of its blessing was dead.
