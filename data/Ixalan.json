{"text": "Ixalan Booster Battle Packs Card comparisons Deck Builder's Toolkit Planeswalker decks Ixalan [\u02c8\u026ak.s\u0259.l\u0251\u02d0n] (pronounced \"icks-a-lawn\", rhymes like \"fix a con\") is the 76th Magic expansion, and the first in the Ixalan block . It was released on September 29, 2017, and is a large expansion . Ixalan contains 279 cards (20 basic land, 101 common, 80 uncommon, 63 rare, and 15 mythic rare) and includes randomly inserted premium versions of all cards. Ten additional cards are found in the set's planeswalker decks (2 mythic planeswalkers, 2 rares, 2 uncommons, 2 commons, and 2 common dual lands). These are numbered #280/279 to #289/279. Ten of the rares are double-faced cards which were printed on a separate print sheet . These appear in the rare/mythic slot of booster packs, which changes the mythic rare to rare ratio from 15:106 to 15:126. A checklist card replaces the basic land in some boosters. Five of the basic lands depict a lost Jace Beleren . A complete Ixalan rare foil print sheet was leaked three months before prerelease, which caused Wizards of the Coast to re-evaluate their preview plan. A number of non-foil, double-sided Ixalan cards were mistakenly printed on incorrect card stock. Starting with this set, all planeswalkers past, present, and future have the supertype legendary . They are subject to the \" legend rule \" instead of the \" planeswalker uniqueness rule \", which was removed from the game. This is a story about desire. It is desire for power, desire for companionship, desire for approval, desire for discovery, and everyone is racing to get what they want first. For centuries, the untamed jungles of Ixalan have hidden a coveted secret: Orazca , the city of gold, which houses a mysterious artifact, the Immortal Sun . But no secret can remain undiscovered, and no treasure can be taken uncontested. The dinosaur riding warriors of the Sun Empire and the merfolk shamans of the rival River Heralds are met by the vampire conquistadores of the Legion of Dusk and the pirates of the Brazen Coalition . Vraska poses as a pirate on the high seas, while Jace Beleren is stranded on the plane with loss of all his memories. The cards that represent the Story Spotlights in Ixalan are: Ixalan's Binding , Vraska's Contempt , River's Rebuke , Thaumatic Compass // Spires of Orazca , and Perilous Voyage . Main article: Magic Story Ixalan is sold in 16-card boosters (one card being a marketing card ), two planeswalker decks , the Ixalan bundle , Booster Battle Packs and a Deck Builder's Toolkit . There is no Masterpiece Series accompanying Ixalan . The boosters feature artwork from Slash of Talons , Vicious Conquistador , Hijack , Fire Shrine Keeper and Vraska, Relic Seeker . As part of the preview season, Wizards of the Coast distributed trackable game pieces to stores, fans, volunteers, and some well-known community folk. As game pieces travelled from from geochache to geocache , the distances they travelled  influenced the release of preview cards.

Treasure artifact (Legion of Dusk flavored) Treasure artifact (River Heralds flavored) Treasure artifact (Brazen Coalition flavored) Ixalan is a tribal set, with Pirates ( ), Dinosaurs ( ), Merfolk ( ) and Vampires ( ). This is the first time Magic has an uneven color distribution of factions within a set. Though the tribes are asymmetrical, the colors are not. Each color has two tribes. The fact that Pirates and Dinosaurs both need more cards to become tribes properly (as compared to merfolk and vampires, who are already pretty established) was a factor in them becoming the two 3 color factions. The two colour pairs that are not represented in this scheme - and - do not have multicoloured signpost uncommons, but have explore and fliers as a theme respectively. Raid returns from Khans of Tarkir (now connected to Pirates), Crew from Kaladesh (connected to the ships from Torrezon), and Transform from Innistrad (the double-faced cards now highlighting the tales and tools of discovery). The DFCs all have a land on the \"back\" face cards, which features a  map-inspired card frame . The front face is recognized by the icon of a compass rose and the back face is marked by the land icon last seen in Future Sight . There are two new named mechanics: Explore \u2014 Reveal the top card of your library. Put that card into your hand if it's a land. Otherwise, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature, then put the card back on top or into your graveyard. Enrage \u2014 Whenever a creature with this ability word is dealt damage, it has some consequences. This is the signature mechanic of the Dinosaurs. The Merfolk are difficult to block and grow via +1/+1 counters , while Vampires use life as a resource . Treasure Ixalan introduces the treasure artifact subtype and the return of the dinosaur creature type . The trilobite creature type is new. Vehicles are back from the Kaladesh block in the form of ships. Ixalan has seven cycles , one of which is reprinted, and two mirrored pairs .. Notably, three of these cycles are partial, due to the uneven distribution of colors among the set's tribes: Air Elemental , first printed in Alpha (last seen in Welcome Deck 2017 ).

Main article: Ixalan/Card comparisons Main article: Ixalan/Planeswalker decks Ixalan features two planeswalker decks : Revel in Riches is an alternate-win card . Two red commons printed here ( Fathom Fleet Firebrand and Tilonalli's Knight ) are the first red creatures strictly better than a vanilla bear , as all comparable creatures printed prior Eldritch Moon ' s Falkenrath Reaver have downside abilities. Dragonskull Summit ( Ixalan ) attempts to justify its name through flavor text, one of the more obvious mismatches between established lore and reprinted land names. Hostage Taker received errata before it was released, because as worded it could create an infinite loop. Many of the backsides of the transforming cards are inspired by powerful lands in Magic's past: Adanto, the First Fort resembles Kjeldoran Outpost Itlimoc, Cradle of the Sun resembles Gaea's Cradle Spitfire Bastion resembles Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle Temple Of Aclazotz resembles Diamond Valley . Lost Vale resembles Lotus Vale . Spires of Orazca resembles Maze of Ith . Rampaging Ferocidon was banned in January 2018 alongside Ramunap Ruins to weaken the Mono-Red in that Standard. While not particularly notable in and of itself, it was the first card unbanned in a rotating format on August 2019, allowing play for one month before rotation. A product survey preceding the announcement of the name \"Ixalan\" referred to the set as Atlazan . The asymmetric color structure of the four tribes was repurposed from the early design stage of the Khans of Tarkir block . Some cards represent a specific pirate fleet, four fleets are revealed this way, each one showing its method\u00a0: R&D Narrative Team (November 1, 2017). \" Planeswalker's Guide to Ixalan, Part 1 \". magicthegathering.com .
