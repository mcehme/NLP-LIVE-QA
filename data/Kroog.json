{"text": "Kroog was the capital of the kingdom of Yotia until the collapse of the kingdom at the hands of Mishra during the Brothers' War on Dominaria . It was built on the ancient site of Nyoron . The Yotians decorated everything. In Kroog, as in much of Yotia, even the streets were art. Kroog's design was defined by patterned red brick streets. During festival days, competing for parades to the many gods of Yotia snarled the wide boulevards and cheering crowds thronged in the side streets. The ringing of festival bells crashed and clamored through the city, a high and bright sound of chaotic joy that propelled and intertwined with the music that filled the air. The festivals in Kroog and across Yotia were ebullient and alive. At the height of its power, Kroog was a prosperous city on the Mardun river. The outer district of the city along the Mardun is called the River Wards . The city's other districts included the capital district, the northern district, and multiple southern districts. Kroog was the seat of power for the Warlord of Kroog preceding his death. Urza then assumed control of Kroog for a brief period until the city was sacked by Mishra's dragon engines , led by Traxos , in a single morning in 28 AR . Near Kroog flew the river Mardun , which flooded most of the city after the Sylex Blast . In 85 AR , it was ruled by the warlord Fask. By then, much of the city remained underwater save for the southern districts where the royal palace and noble quarters of the city once stood. Its stone towers crumbled, it became a midden heap of buildings and walkways huddled atop one another, built above the water on stilts. Its citizens had become devoted either to harvesting the bounty of the lake or raiding along the river to grow the warlord's wealth. His reign ended around 85 AR. Fask's end saw his realm carved up between rising domains and hungry warlords. New Yotia and the Talites conquered and annexed the eastern half of his domain while Fask's rivals tore apart the western half. The ruins of Kroog can currently be found on the island of Yavimaya . The largest group of elvish Yavimayan exiles, led by Meria , live among these ruins. Kayla bin-Kroog Rusko Referred to:"}
