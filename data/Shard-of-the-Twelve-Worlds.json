{"text": "The Shard of the Twelve Worlds was an envelope containing twelve planes , separating them from the rest of the Multiverse . The Golgothian Sylex explosion. The only planes confirmed to be within the Shard were Dominaria , Azoria , and Ravidel 's home plane. The Nether Void was accessible within the Shard, but whether it qualifies as a plane is unknown. Phyrexia was outside of the Shard. The Shard was formed as a side-effect of the Sylex Blast . The blast bound several \"nearby\" planes together, forming the Dominarian Nexus , and also formed a barrier to travel in or out of the nexus. Many planeswalkers were trapped inside the Shard during the Ice Age . The plane of Shandalar drifts through the Multiverse in unusual ways, and it passed through the boundary of the Shard. This allowed Faralyn , Leshrac , and Tevesh Szat to escape by planeswalking to it. Later, Freyalise used the energy of its passing to fuel the World Spell which broke the Shard, and coincidentally ended the Ice Age ."}
