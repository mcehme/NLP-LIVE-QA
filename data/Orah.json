{"text": "Orah is a Kor Cleric who is deeply connected to ancient kor civilizations from Zendikar . He is a member of the Sea Gate Expeditionary House . Orah has a long white beard, gray eyes, and a library's worth of knowledge within his head. He carries a staff. During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , his right hand began going through phyresis , turning brittle and white with black veins, until Linvala was able to burn the oil away. Orah lived his life in awe of the past, learning what he could from the various ruins. Over time, he became quite the master cleric, among the best on Zendikar. Ironically, the past took everything away from him. When the Eldrazi returned, his family was lost in the struggle. Listless, he wandered the plane. When the Skyclaves rose again, he took it as a sign that he must rise again himself. Orah realized that the easiest way to get inside of a Skyclave would be to join the Sea Gate restoration efforts, as they frequently sent parties to explore the ruins for supplies. He found a vacancy in Akiri 's party and then found much more. He couldn't shake how much Akiri, Zareth San , and Kaza reminded him of the children he had lost\u2014and vowed to protect them as if they were his own. After the defeat of the Eldrazi, Orah and his three friends were hired by Nahiri to accompany her to the Murasa Skyclave . After the discovery of the Core, Elementals attacked and Kaza and Orah were separated from the rest of the party . Akiri later located them with the help of Jace Beleren . After Zendikar became a target in New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Tazri had a halo-infused vision. She sent Akiri, Linvala, Kaza, and Orah to Emeria , where they witnessed the return of the compleated Nahiri . Joined by Tazri, the party attacked the planeswalker in the heart of Emeria's transformed Skyclave . Though Nahiri at first gained the upper hand with ease infecting Kaza's right hand with phyresis , the fight turned as the angels of New Capenna entered the Multiverse and gave angels everywhere access to Halo . With Linvala's newfound strength, and Tazri's halo, the party managed to break Nahiri loose from the reformed Hedron network and knock her from her feet, with Linvala burning the oil out of Orah's infected hand. As they escaped, they witnessed the Skyclave breaking and crashing to the ground with Nahiri still inside."}
