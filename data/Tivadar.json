{"text": "Tivadar of Thorn was the leader of the Knights of Thorn during the Dark on Dominaria . He led a major campaign against the goblins and orcs of Terisiare alongside Rasputin Dreamweaver . Tivadar was born in the town of Thorn in northeastern Terisiare and was probably disenfranchised by a goblin attack. As a young boy, he joined the army of the city-state of Ghed , where he briefly served with the wizard Jodah , who deserted during the Battle of Pitdown . Even as a child, he believed that the wars between the city-states were pointless and distracted humanity from their true enemy, the savage goblins. Later in life, Tivadar penned The History of the Goblin Wars . Associated cards: Quoted or referred to:"}
