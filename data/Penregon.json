{"text": "Penregon was the capital of Argive during the Dominarian Brothers' War . It was located on the east coast of Terisiare along the Visceral Sea, south of the Sardian Mountains , east of the Kher Ridges and north of Korlis . Penregon survived the Sylex Blast but was severely damaged. The blast caused terrible earthquakes that leveled most of the city's stone and brick buildings, collapsing them on top of their occupants. The king and his court, sheltering in the Lion's Hall \u2014 the mighty citadel perched on the vertiginous cliffs overlooking Penregon Harbor \u2014 collapsed into the sea. Massive tidal waves followed, pounding the coastal districts, scouring the city streets, and scraping them clean of rubble and survivors. When the shaking stopped and the water receded, Kayla bin-Kroog was one of the few nobles left alive. As the wife of the alliance's leader and a princess herself, the rule of the city fell to her. Kayla tried to rebuild the city with help of Tawnos and his civil automatons . The use of the very machines that had been used in the War angered the fledgling Church of Tal , which attacked and nearly destroyed the city over a single day in the spring of 69 AR . Though the Talites were defeated within and without the city, the repentant Tawnos destroyed Urza's archives and left the city. This ended the age of artifice in Penregon. The city only lasted ten years more after the Siege of Penregon, when the inhabitants fled to the west to avoid the encroaching cold. The location of Penregon would later become the site of Kjeld and eventually the city of Argivia ."}
