{"text": "The Wanderer is a former planeswalker introduced in War of the Spark . She is the current Emperor of Kamigawa , and one of the most efficient and deadly warriors seen on any plane. She lost her spark during the Great Pruning , but unlike her fellow planeswalkers, this was a great benefit to her. The Wanderer is a traveling swordswoman with snow-white hair and brown eyes. As Emperor of Kamigawa, she is unable to reveal her name to anyone. Her bond with the kami Kyodai is embodied by the kami Himoto . As the Wanderer, she hides her face behind a wide-brimmed hat and wears white garb. Beneath the brim of her hat, she wears a golden mask that covers her entire visage and even keeps her eyes in the shadow. Because she admitted that she once was considered to be beautiful, Ral Zarek suspected that her real face was now scarred. The Wanderer didn't deny this and implied that Tezzeret was to blame for her disfigurement. When she briefly returned to Kamigawa, it turned out that it was her planeswalker spark and not her appearance that was damaged. The Wanderer is adept at swordplay and can magically absorb kinetic energy and redirect that force through her massive sword. The broadsword leaves a white mana trail in its wake when she swings it. She often appears without warning to aid in a battle or defend the innocent, only to disappear just as suddenly without explanation. Able to down the largest foes with a single stroke, The Wanderer is also cursed to make an effort not to planeswalk. Unlike other planeswalkers who are tired by the process of planeswalking, The Wanderer can planeswalk and then planeswalk again almost immediately - but if she doesn't focus, she will be pulled at random from plane to plane. This also happens when she sleeps or falls unconscious. Her condition makes her uniquely attuned to the Blind Eternities . She feels every ripple across it and can sense a planeswalker's path longer than a typical planeswalker. The Wanderer is centered in white mana. When she planeswalks, she disappears in a violent flash of white light. When she has control over her spark, she is able to planeswalk within the same plane. The Wanderer and Kaito have known each other since childhood. When they were young, the Wanderer and Kaito Shizuki became friends and sparring partners. Around age fourteen, her spark was ignited when the planeswalker Tezzeret attempted to control the kami Kyodai with a prototype Reality Chip . The Chip left her spark unstable, causing the irregularities with her planeswalking ability. On her first day of training, her mentor Light-Paws gave her a puppy, telling her to raise it by hand: care for this dog now, so you can care for the kingdom in the future. The young emperor took these words to heart, and Yoshimaru became the most intelligent, most loyal dog the court had ever seen. She loved having a friend whom she could share her Imperial secrets with and relieve the burden of responsibility. The Wanderer is able to channel kinetic energy to her sword The Wanderer was lured to Ravnica by the Interplanar Beacon , and immediately became trapped there due to Bolas 's use of the Immortal Sun . Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, she fought against the Eternals of Bolas' Dreadhorde . She and Sarkhan Vol knew each other. She was one of the few planeswalkers who chose to remain on Ravnica after Chandra disabled the Immortal Sun, helping the Gatewatch in their fight against Bolas. She survived the battle. In Ikoria . As her unique abilities allowed her to track Tezzeret and the Planar Bridge technology he carried, the Wanderer aided Ral Zarek in finding his target. They eventually found Tezzeret in his fortress on Alara in Esper , once known as the Seekers' Sanctum . The pair were greeted by a squadron of etherium gargoyles in which all but the leader, Brokk , were destroyed. Ral and the Wanderer entered Tezzeret's base and battled against his minions through multiple traps. Upon reaching Tezzeret, the Wanderer was knocked unconscious by the lead gargoyle and automatically planeswalked away. After regaining consciousness, the Wanderer returned to Esper to investigate Tezzeret's fortress and found evidence of an organized abandonment. Back on Ravnica, the Wanderer relayed her newfound information at the guild meeting after Ral Zarek told the truth about his defeat. The Wanderer also revealed that she could no longer sense the Planar Bridge technology which indicated that Tezzeret may have intended to be followed. The Wanderer was briefly present on Ikoria , where Vivien Reid saw her cut down a monster before planeswalking away. The Wanderer was briefly able to return to her home plane, meet Kaito , and with the stabilization offered by the Reality Chip , she was able to reconnect with Kyodai and Kaito Shizuki . Before her spark became unstable again, she and the spirit agreed to appoint Light-Paws acting Regent of Kamigawa. The Wanderer, along with other planeswalkers and Mirrans survivors, launch a final assault on New Phyrexia . The Wanderer and Kaito joined the Gatewatch and other assembled planeswalkers to support the Mirrans ' efforts against Elesh Norn on New Phyrexia . However, the presence of a \"planar shield\" seriously disrupted the Wanderer's spark upon arrival, giving her only enough time to accompany Kaito and Nahiri to the outskirts of a Mirran camp before involuntarily planeswalking away. While Planeswalking through New Phyrexia, she eventually reached the Hunter Maze and came across Nissa Revane and Lukka fighting Phyrexian beasts. She provided some assistance before forcibly planeswalking away. She returned to and planeswalked away from the two intermittently while helping them slay Phyrexians. Once she met up with them near the center of the Maze, she revealed she knew where Vorinclex was and suggested that they should eliminate him while they had the chance. She planeswalked away before the two travelled to the praetor's chamber, but she returned to see Lukka compleated and bought Nissa time to flee. Upon her return to the Mirran encampment where she had left Kaito and Nahiri, she discovered it razed to the ground. After the failed attempt to stop New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , the Wanderer ended up on the pocket plane of Zhalfir , where she was temporarily caught in an Amber Prison and reconnected with Teferi Akosa . Returning to Kamigawa, the Wanderer returned just in time to save Kaito once again and kill Tamiyo . Before the Moonfolk died, she beseeched the Wanderer to take care of her son Nashi . In the aftermath of the invasion, Kaito and the Wanderer led reconstruction efforts on Kamigawa. The Wanderer lost her spark in the Great Pruning , using this opportunity to travel her home plane while Light-Paws continued ruling as regent. The Wanderer is the only carded planeswalker character without a planeswalker type . The Wanderer appears in the teaser, cinematic, and animated trailers for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty . The Wanderer has a sword that she uses to channel kinetic energy into powerful attacks. For a short time, she was attached to the Reality Chip . Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
