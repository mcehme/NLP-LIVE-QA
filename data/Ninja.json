{"text": "Ninja (NIN-ja) is a creature class . Most ninjas are blue , black , or both. Ninjas, also called Shinobi (shee-NO-bee), are masters of both stealth and armed combat who may find employment as spies , warriors , mercenaries or assassins ; they are famed for their versatility. Secretive in the extreme, some ninja practice magic that further enhances their abilities of infiltration. Some ninja come together in clans, though many others are solitary rogues. The ninjutsu ability and its variant commander ninjutsu are exclusive to ninjas. Until 2017 the only sets featuring Ninjas were Betrayers of Kamigawa and Planechase 2012 (in the Night of the Ninja deck). They reappeared in the silver-bordered Unstable and in Commander 2018 ( Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow ). According to Mark Rosewater , it was likely that Ninjas would also return to black border . That came true when they appeared in Modern Horizons . This set featured Ninjas from several planes and with several creature types (including Vampire , Illusion , and Spirit ), with many of them also featuring the ninjutsu ability. Incidentally, this set introduced the first black-border Ninjas without the ninjutsu ability, with Phantom Ninja having a ninjutsu-enabling ability and Throatseeker having a ninjutsu-benefitting ability. Ninjas return to Standard Magic in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty . Fewer Ninjas have saboteur abilities, with designs leaning towards developing tricky combat steps, and many also do not have ninjutsu. There also is the first white Ninja and four green Ninjas. Among the green Ninjas, there is one that is also a Turtle, which, alongside a Rat Ninja lord with a cane that lives in the sewers, likely takes inspiration from the comic book series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Duel Decks: Pirates vs. Ninjas was a joke Duel Deck set for April Fools' Day 2008. The set has not been released as a product."}
