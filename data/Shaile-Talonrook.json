{"text": "Dean Shaile Talonrook is a bird cleric teacher at the Silverquill College of Strixhaven University on Arcavios . She was compleated during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse . Dean Shaile used to be a perennially optimistic owlin with a powerful, dramatic speaking voice. She was a master of literature and often quoted obscure passages from famous texts. Her soul-filling advice and educated references had been known to make people literally glow. Shaile believed that people were generally good and wishes to teach her students how to make the world a better place. She and Dean Embrose often clashed over Silverquill's curriculum, but the balance found between them is far more eloquent than even their words can describe. After being compleated during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Shaile's tongue and beak were replaced by a spreading web of metal filaments. She attacked the remaining students but was thwarted by Embrose Lu . Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
