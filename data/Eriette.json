{"text": "Eriette is a powerful witch from Eldraine . Eriette is a beautiful woman with platinum-blonde hair and rich gold eyes, but is vain and controlling. She wears a black gown with a glass Medici collar that reflects an aged crone, suggesting she uses a glamour to mask her appearance. She carries a glass apple with strands of translucent violet snaking out, her gift from the fae lord Talion . She is the sister of Agatha , Hylda , and an unnamed witch who was the birth mother of the Kenrith twins. After New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , she claimed Castle Ardenvale and declared herself the Ardent Queen . Eriette and her sisters Agatha and Hylda helped the faerie Talion cast the Wicked Slumber to end the Phyrexian Invasion of Eldraine . In exchange, Talion gave her the Charmed Apple, which grants her the love of anyone who takes a bite. However, the witches deigned not to undo the spell even after the defeat of the Praetors, leaving a slowly destabilizing kingdom on both sides of the veil. Eriette specifically reanimated the sleeping forms as a court of her own in the ruins of Ardenvale , assisted by Ashiok . When Rowan Kenrith approached Ardenvale in search of an answer to the Slumber, Eriette enticed her with the promise of power, regard, and security. She was captured during an attack by Will Kenrith and his knights, but was later freed by Ashiok. An evil queen who wants to be the fairest of the land, Eriette is based on the evil queen of Snow White . Notably, she never interacts with the analogue of the princess, Neva . Eriette appears in the trailer for Wilds of Eldraine . Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
