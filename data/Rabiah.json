{"text": "An oasis in Rabiah. Art by Brian Sn\u00f5ddy Rabiah is a collection of one thousand and one originally identical planes , all refracted off of the original Rabiah during the Thousandfold Refraction . It is for this reason that Rabiah is known as \"the Infinite\". Over the centuries, these planes have since developed independently of each other. However, there are some general features that are consistent across almost all variations of Rabiah. Rabiah is a desert world. Where Rabiah's plane touches another, the severe environment often begins to \"infect\" its neighbor. However, that rarely worries Rabiah's inhabitants, since they are hardy desert dwellers. Planar links in Rabiah often appear in the form of giant desert twisters. Such dust storms violently propel any who venture too near them into the particular plane the gates link to. One plane often linked to Rabiah is Wildfire ; another one is Dominaria , in particular the continent of Jamuraa . Although most Rabian cultures are patriarchal and Arabic in feel, the vast range of Rabiahs also includes matriarchy. Furthermore, one plane, known as Dark Rabiah , has been taken over by sinister forces and is as evil a place as even Phyrexia . Rabiah was the setting for the Arabian Nights expansion, and was based upon the One Thousand and One Nights collection of stories. A variety of characters are connected to the multitude of planes which compose Rabiah: Abu Ja'far El-Hajj\u00e2j King Suleiman Nailah Najal Raghib Taysir Alexandria ( Library of Alexandria ) Baghdad ( Bazaar of Baghdad ) Bassorah ( Bazaar of Bassorah , Mosque Quarter of Bassorah ) Cairo ( Ali from Cairo ) City of Brass Crags of Jaruq ( Castle of El-Hajj\u00e2j ) Crags of Sana'a ( Nailah's Keep ) Fa'adiyah Island of Wak-Wak Karun Desert Sea of Sand Serendib ( Serendib Efreet ) Humans Camels Elephants Giant Fish Dand\u00e2n Island-Fish Giant Tortoises The Djinni True Djinn Djann Efreet Nekrataal Marid Ghoul The Guardian Beast Ogres Devils Bird Maidens Jackals Apes Rukhs Asps Singing Trees Wolves Brass Men Dancing Scimitars Bees Horses Fatima Taysir Mark Rosewater stated that Rabiah will likely never be revisited in a Standard-legal set, due to the fact that it is not Wizard's own intellectual property. Continued prompting on this subject led him to create the Rabiah Scale , as a planar equivalent of the Storm Scale , on which Rabiah holds the highest (least likely) rank by definition. Even with the advent of the Universes Beyond creative treatment, Rosewater maintains that the plane as designed is not revisitable, but a mythology-inspired plane would have better odds. Outside of its plane card , Rabiah is only referred to by name in the flavor text of Sorceress Queen and Suleiman's Legacy . Although Sorceress Queen was printed in Arabian Nights , only its Fifth Edition reprint has flavor text. The plane is alluded to in the flavor text of Tempest Djinn . Referred to:"}
