{"text": "The planeswalker Grenfell Mor was of the founding sages of Minorad on Dominaria , and an advisor to the queen of Corundis . He reluctantly agreed not to interfere with Ravidel , when the Battlemage threatened to destroy the city. He hid the long-daggers after discovering how to use them to destroy the Golgothian Sylex , but later was banished to the sand seas of Golthonor by Ravidel, where he worked on the rust spell to destroy the Sylex. He was the father of Gwendolynn Mor , who married Adam Carthalion and thus made Grenfell Mor the grandfather of Jared Carthalion . He tried to kill Jared with Valthus , his leviathan , when the Wayfarer came to Telemar City with Kristina of the Woods , but failed. Grenfell Mor may have been a descendant of Gydolien Mor , though this is uncertain. In the unpublished comic Planeswalkers War , Grenfell Mor is killed by Sandruu .
