{"text": "Angus was a holy man who witnessed a jealous, unnamed planeswalker attack Serra on the Plains of Sursi . He distracted Serra's planeswalker assailant and ran off with Serra's dying body. Serra blessed the land with her passing, flooding it with holy power to be a sanctuary against the dark forces that assailed her followers. Angus made her comfortable in her last days and built a temple in her honor: the origins of the Cathedral of Serra . To this day, Serra Angels sometimes spontaneously appear in the Cathedral. The cantos of the Song of All #1001 to #1020 are known as Brother Angus's Lament . He added them after Serra had imparted her wisdom to him before dying."}
