{"text": "The Apocalypse Chime was a massively powerful artifact owned by the Tolgath . The master of Ravi gave it to her, telling her to use it in only the most sinister of times and promising her it would cleanse the world. However, her master didn't tell everything, because nobody who would have known the effects of the chime would have rung it. As the Tolgath and the Ancients fought the Great War on Ulgrotha , Ravi, hoping to stop the killing, rang the chime and destroyed both parties, resulting in the Great Destruction that formed the Dead Zone by disrupting the world's mana channels and killing almost all creatures on the plane. As instructed, Ravi hid in a magical coffin, in the Basalt Spire , to escape the effects of the Chime; however, her master never told the girl how to open the coffin. Trapped, Ravi lay in stasis, awake, unable to dream, aware of every second for centuries. Her spirit was rapidly broken, and claustrophobia set in, with madness following. After centuries, Baron Sengir found and freed her. Now called Grandmother Sengir, she still had the Apocalypse Chime when Serra and Feroz visited Castle Sengir . In her madness, she seems to have forgotten the effect of the chime, and seems to ominously contemplate the possibility to ring it again.
