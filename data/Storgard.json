{"text": "Storgard was a kingdom in the Dark Age and the onset of the Ice Age of Dominaria . It was located in the Sardian Mountains of Terisiare and ruled by five clans: Ruby , Emerald , Onyx , Pearl and Sapphire . It was the birthplace of Freyalise . Because it had taken in refugees from Sarpadia , it sometimes is considered the last of the Fallen Empires . During the Ice Age the kingdom became covered in the ice of the massive Raynor Glacier . The last king before the destruction by the glaciers of Lim-D\u00fbl and Tevesh Szat was Miko . The Emerald and Pearl clans left the doomed capital after it was destroyed in a fight between Tevesh Szat, Freyalise and Jason Carthalion . Their descendants founded Kjeldor more to the south. Many years after the fall of Storgard the city of Soldev was built on its ruins. Storgard castle The Bridge of Hielos , the highest bridge of Storgard Raynor Heights , a viewpoint over the glacier"}
