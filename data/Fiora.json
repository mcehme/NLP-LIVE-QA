{"text": "Fiora is the birth plane of the planeswalkers Dack Fayden and Daretti . It was first seen in the IDW comic The Spell Thief , and later featured in the Conspiracy sets. Fiora strongly resembles a renaissance era city with Italian-style architecture, predominantly with domed roofs. Fiora is home to countless intrigues and plots. The high lords of the High City of Paliano vie for supremacy. Move is met with countermove, and trust with betrayal, all under the auspices of the monarch of the moment. Those who sit in the legislative seats of the High City control the vote, and the laws issued from Paliano mystically bind the populace. Murder, manslaughter, and violence have never been outlawed \u2014 in fact, they are tools utilized by politicians and nobility regularly. Artifact creatures doing menial tasks used to be part of every household. However, cogwork was eliminated from the streets of Paliano, after the bid for power by Muzzio . The former king, Brago , and the Custodi closed down Academy, happy that those who stood against them were absent or dead. The current queen is Marchesa , the Black Rose. Outside of Paliano, the populace lives in smaller towns run by the local government equally rife with corruption and back-alley dealings. The expansive wilderness of Fiora remains unexplored.
