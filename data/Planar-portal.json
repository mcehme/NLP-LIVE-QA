{"text": "A planar portal is a way to travel through the aether between planes , without needing a planeswalker's spark . Planar portals can be created by planeswalkers , but the Thran and the Phyrexians also had the technology. Known planar portals include: The portals from Dominaria : The portal to Phyrexia in the Caves of Koilos , created by the planeswalker Dyfed . The second portal to Phyrexia, opened by Jarsyl . The Jamuraan portals to Wildfire and Rabiah The Talon Gates connected to Kamigawa . The portal from Sursi to Ulgrotha . The Skyship Weatherlight was able to travel between planes before the Great Mending . The Dwarven Gate on Ulgrotha in the abandoned dwarven city under Castle Sengir . Where it leads is unknown. The portals of Rath The portals in the skies that captured its citizens from other planes. The portal within the throne room of the Stronghold which allowed Yawgmoth to enter Dominaria personally during the Phyrexian Invasion . The flying portals, or portal ships, used during that invasion. The Erratic Portal between Rath (originally on Phyrexia itself when used by Ramos ) and Mercadia , guarded by the Soltari . The Soul traps created by Memnarch on Mirrodin . The Drownyard temple on Innistrad, used by Nahiri to bring Emrakul to the plane. The Riddle Gate on Esper , used by Tezzeret to visit the Metal Island . The Planar Bridge created by the inventor Rashmi on Kaladesh , now under the command of Tezzeret. The portal from the Meditation Plane to Ravnica , used in the resurrection of Niv-Mizzet . When the Mending occurred, all artificial planar portals stopped working. New tech was possible, but so far the only example seen is the Planar Bridge , which has major limitations transporting organic matter. Vorinclex used an unexplained portal between New Phyrexia and Kaldheim . Tezzeret was revealed as being in league with New Phyrexia in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty , and Vorinclex was stripped of organic tissue on his initial arrival on Kaldheim, which revealed the Planar Bridge was the method. Other Praetors visited other planes by the same method. Realmbreaker used the dynamics of the World Tree 's omenpaths as a way to forcibly link planes from New Phyrexia across the multiverse. Despite New Phyrexia later being pocketed away into the Zhalfirin planar knot and Realmbreaker's demise, the omenpaths still exist across the multiverse, additionally influenced by the detonation of the Filigree Sylex in the Blind Eternities . After New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse and the Great Pruning , the omenpaths are now the main way to travel between planes . Referred to:"}
