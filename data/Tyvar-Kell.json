{"text": "Tyvar Kell , Prince of Kaldheim , is an elf and former planeswalker . The younger brother of King Harald , uniter of Kaldheim's two groups of elves , Tyvar is a confident, charismatic, and pale-skinned wood elf. He is short and sports a muscular frame and long, braided auburn hair. He rarely wears a shirt, exposing his powerful physique and distinctive tattoos of Koma , the \"cosmos serpent\" of Kaldheim, whom all elves possess a shared reverence for. The tattoo's twin dagger shapes and the double-bladed sword he fights with each represent the snake's fangs. He loves to boast, always on the hunt for glory and the admiration of his peers. When he planeswalks, he arrives with the blare of a war horn. Though he's certainly preoccupied with building his legend, Tyvar has a peculiar relationship with fame. After an epic battle, he's just as likely to sing the praises of his allies as he is to brag about his achievements. He's a classic extrovert at heart who enjoys the camaraderie shared among warriors. He actively seeks out allies willing to fight by his side and share a drink to celebrate their glorious victory afterward. Tyvar is a formidable close-combat fighter. His weapon of choice is a double-bladed sword he wears on a bronze bracer strapped to his arm. Tyvar can transmute natural substances (including his own body and the bodies of those around him) into other close-by natural materials, letting him use the environment to his advantage in combat in a special way. Deeply flexible, this ability greatly helps with improvising during a battle; he might coat himself in stone or thorns for protection, or in the inverse cool molten rock to a solid or make nettles sprout from the ground beneath his foes. Tyvar's abilities are very flexible but limited by what kinds of natural terrain are immediately at hand. This makes him a natural improviser in combat, and he relishes the creativity battle requires. Tyvar's powers aren't limited to himself, he can also share these buffs with his allies. He has stated his power works differently depending on the plane he is on. He also isn't always aware of how his power will work until having tried it. Kaya Cassir notes that his powers are that of a transmuter, but unlike one she has ever met. When he used his powers on New Phyrexia , it emitted a plantlike smell that Kaya recognized as that of Kaldheim air. Tyvar is primarily green -aligned but has access to black mana . Tibalt (disguised as Valki ) visited Harald and advised the King to prepare his army for the coming war. Suspicious of this \"Valki\", Tyvar began to follow and investigate the god through the realms. When Tyvar arrived at Gnottvold , he found Kaya surrounded by Torga trolls woken by Tibalt. The elf helped Kaya by defeating the trolls, turning them into stone. After Tibalt escaped to Immersturm , he opened an omenpath to that realm. At that moment Kaya discovered a small hedron from Zendikar hanging around his neck. Tyvar had believed Zendikar to be a distant realm from Kaldheim itself, and Kaya had to explain that he was a planeswalker . Together the two decided to work to investigate and stop Tibalt's plans. The pair followed Tibalt to Immersturm where they were accosted by a couple of demons . Because of this, they were unable to prevent Tibalt from creating a Doomskar . Led by Varragoth , thousands of demons streamed through a giant rift in space to attack another realm. Kaya felt defeated, but Tyvar persuaded her to stay and fight. In Bretagard , Tyvar, Kaya and the leaders of the Clans were advised by Alrund to take the Sword of the Realms to Halvar , so that the god of battle could end the Doomskar . Mounted on a giant raven Tyvar, Kaya, and Arni flew toward Halvar , but near the destination, they were attacked in midair by the demon Varragoth who wanted the Sword for himself. Kaya used her powers to save her companions from certain death, but they ended up falling close to the Dread Marn, Karfell 's army. Arni stayed behind to slow down the zombies while the two planeswalkers would take the Sword. In the middle of the way, Tyvar heard the sound of the horn of Skemfar 's army and separated from Kaya to warn his brother of what was happening. Tyvar explained the situation to Harald , who decided to help fight the invading army and help deliver the Sword to Halvar. Near the location of Halvar, Kaya was attacked once again by Varragoth, but was saved by the elves . While Tyvar and the army of elves fought the demons and zombies , Harald helped Kaya to reach Halvar. Tyvar used his transmuting powers to strengthen his allies and hinder opponents and tried as hard as possible to stop Varragoth, but the demon was only stopped by Kaya who cut the demon's throat with one of the axes Tyvar had made for her. After the great battle and the end of the Doomskar, Tyvar met Kaya and praised her for killing Varragoth and promised that the skalds would not forget any detail of this feat when telling this saga . He told Kaya that he now was ready to walk the Multiverse and help those in need on other planes . Tyvar answered Jace Beleren 's call for help against New Phyrexia. On Ravnica , his habit of not wearing shirts left an impression on Chandra. Tyvar preparing to strike a compleated Tibalt. As part of the planeswalker strike team to deactivate Realmbreaker , Tyvar travelled to New Phyrexia. Here, he learned to protect himself with hexgold . The team of planeswalkers descended with Melira to the Dross Pits , where Elspeth provided them with Halo to counteract the effects of the Necrogen . However, Jace inexplicably reacted adversely to the potent elixir and collapsed. After recovering, Jace's mind was focused on Vraska, whom he perceived to need help. Abandoning the group, he set out to find her. Because he carried the Sylex , the complete group set out after him. Finding Vraska in Sheoldred's Coliseum , they found she was heavily wounded and already infected with Phyresis . Too late to save her, Jace chose to stay behind with her and relive their happy moments on Ravnica in his mind. Lingering too long, Vraska succumbed to the Phyrexian influence and infected Jace in turn. The others tried to escape but were quickly overwhelmed by the black Phyrexians. Nahiri, who was also infected, decided to sacrifice herself for the greater good. With a mighty magical blast, she exploded the Coliseum and dropped it with all remaining planeswalkers on the Fair Basilica . Nearer to their goal, the infected Jace rejoined them and volunteered to bring the Sylex to the Seedcore . Creating a hexgold shield, Tyvar protected the group in the Mycosynth Gardens . On the way to the Seedcore, the strike team was confronted by the compleated Ajani and Tyvar's old nemesis Tibalt. Kaito, Kaya, and Jace took the Sylex to the Seedcore while Tyvar confronted the two Phyrexian planeswalkers alongside Elspeth. While she fought Ajani, Tyvar engaged Tibalt in a rematch, ultimately claiming victory by stabbing him through his chest cavity with his barbed tails. After Tibalt and Ajani were dispatched, Elspeth and Tyvar rejoined their comrades, only to see Elspeth impale Jace with Luxior and disappear alongside the Sylex. He rallied Kaya and Kaito, the two remaining members of the team, but his inspirational speech was interrupted by the arrival of Elesh Norn , Tamiyo , and a newly compleated Nissa Revane . The planeswalkers defiantly told Norn they would never join her, but in response, she activated Realmbreaker and began the interplanar Phyrexian invasion. After the three surviving planeswalkers witnessed Nahiri being sent to Zendikar to conquer her homeplane, they were able to escape. Norn wanted them to tell their allies of their inescapable fate. Recounting their tale to Liliana Vess , Chandra Nalaar , and Wrenn , Tyvar's characterization of the planeswalkers' compleations as noble sacrifices angered Vess. During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Tyvar joined his brother Harald to lead the defense of Skemfar \u2014 and later all ten realms of Kaldheim \u2014 against the intruders. He engaged in single combat with a massive, porcelain-plated, eyeless Phyrexian serpent , emerging victorious with the serpent's head after a five-minute underwater battle. In the aftermath of the Invasion, Tyvar was desparked in the Great Pruning . A piece of hexgold . Tyvar appeared in the teaser trailer for Kaldheim . In the video game Magic: The Gathering Arena , Tyvar is voiced by Eric Tiede. In the story for Phyrexia: All Will Be One , Tyvar's weapon is described as being strapped to his left arm, while all of his art depicts it on his right.
