His true name was never revealed. In ancient Dominaria, centuries before the cataclysmic Brothers' War , Carth the Lion took part in an uprising against the evil planeswalker Geyadrone Dihada . The uprising failed, and Carth was forced to watch as Dihada's champion, Sol'Kanar , murdered one hundred of his tribesfolk, including his mother and sister. Carth set out to punish the demon planeswalker for destroying his home town .
