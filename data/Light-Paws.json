{"text": "Light-Paws is a kitsune advisor at the Imperial Palace in Eiganjo Castle , Kamigawa . She is the current Regent of Kamigawa until the Emperor 's return. In her youth, the intelligent Light-Paws graduated at the top of her Golden-Tail Academy class and started work within the Imperial Court , overseeing and regulating the sites where the spirit and mortal realms merged . She took her duty very seriously out of genuine concern for her people's safety. Her career looked promising until a lost kami burst through the construction site and began hurting people in its confusion. Risking her life, the unarmed Light-Paws stood her ground against the enraged kami and talked it down using diplomacy alone. In that moment, she earned her second tail. The then-emperor was so impressed by Light-Paws's tact and skill that he invited her to be his personal advisor and teach the younger generations who lived within the palace walls. Since then, Light-Paws's long lifetime has seen her advise several emperors of Kamigawa , and her seven tails were a sign of the wisdom that earned her great reverence throughout the entire Imperial Court. Light-Paws was the mentor of young Eiko and Kaito Shizuki . While she was successful in training Eiko as a Kami Intercessor, her relation with Kaito became strained. After the mysterious disappearance of her other ward, the current Emperor , Kaito left Eiganjo . Ten years later, the planeswalking Emperor briefly returned to the plane, and appointed Light-Paws as acting Regent of Kamigawa. Upon her appointment to this position, Light-Paws grew an eighth tail. In the aftermath of New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , the Emperor lost her spark in the Great Pruning . Now relegated to Kamigawa, the Emperor chose to travel the plane while Light-Paws continued ruling as regent in her stead.
