{"text": "Eldraine (pronounced EL-drain ) is a plane introduced in the Throne of Eldraine set and described in Kate Elliott 's The Wildered Quest . It is a world inspired by Arthurian legend and European fairy tales. Eldraine is a medieval world filled with knights , castles, and magical creatures. Wild magic is woven through the heart of the plane and two opposing but intertwined sides battle over it, impossible to untangle one from the other. The Realm used to be ruled by High King Algenus Kenrith . It was split into five courts that came to be after mankind rose and overthrew the Elven Lords that had enslaved them. These are Ardenvale , Vantress , Locthwain , Embereth , and Garenbrig . Here anyone, male, female or otherwise, might be knighted and become a \"Syr.\" Two individuals are chosen each generation by the Questing Beast to possibly become High King and High Queen, both having to make a High Quest throughout the courts and become knighted in each to receive the honor. Outside of the Realm lie the Wilds , a place of untamed magic where the fair folk roams. The Realm was an orderly society consisting of five courts, each of which was aligned with a color, exemplifies a virtue, and had a sacred relic. These relics are mysterious objects with immense magical power and sentience that lie just beyond mortal understanding. They are the physical embodiment of one of five virtues and possess the power to judge those virtues within individuals. Each court had its ruler under the High King and considered its associated virtue to be paramount, though not to the complete exclusion of the other four. After New Phyrexia's Invasion of Eldraine , the High King was killed and the courts fell, plunging the Realm into chaos. It has since achieved an uneasy peace under acting king Will Kenrith . Ardenvale \u2013 Currently abandoned. Formerly ruled by High King Algenus Kenrith and Queen Linden , and later the Ardent Queen Eriette . White-aligned Ardenvale exemplified the virtue of Loyalty and is home to the Circle of Loyalty . A knight must step into the circle, which is made of a brilliant white flame, to prove their loyalty. Ardenvale's symbol is a circle-bound flame. The highlands of Arden Castle Ardenvale The Archer's Tower Wealdrum Trekell Wesling The Choking Drum , a mountainous ridge running between Giant's Jaw Hill and the distant Crown Crag . the lowlands of Ardenvale proper. The Glass Tarn Beckborough The Canton of Kenrith Vantress \u2013 Seat of acting king Will Kenrith . Led by Gadwick , although he is seldom seen. Blue-aligned Vantress exemplifies the virtue of Knowledge. The symbol of Vantress is a keyhole. Castle Vantress Lochmere Delverhaugh , an underground dwarven fortress that was the site of a Grand Ball that was raided by redcaps . Caervelin , a tower and the residence of Gadwick and his apprentice Johann . Accidentally burned down c. 4563. Locthwain \u2013 Ruled by Queen Ayara , an elf . Black-aligned Locthwain exemplifies the virtue of Persistence and was home to the Cauldron of Eternity before it vanished. The Cauldron of Eternity can return those who die back to life if it deems them worthy. Locthwain's symbol is a goblet. Castle Locthwain Embereth \u2013 Ruled by a council, red-aligned Embereth exemplifies the virtue of Courage and is home to the Irencrag , which can empower magical weapons such as the sword Embercleave . It is also the location of a great knight tournament . Embereth's symbol is a triplet of spearheads. The Burning Yard Castle Embereth The Irencrag Garenbrig \u2013 Ruled by King Yorvo , a giant . Green-aligned Garenbrig exemplifies the virtue of Strength and is home to the Great Henge , which can be used to travel between locations on the plane. The symbol of Garenbrig is a pair of hammers. Castle Garenbrig Edgewall Keep , a hovel situated in the lands between the Realm and the Wilds. Lord Skitter rules the sewers below the village. The Three Pigs Butcher Shop The Great Henge The countryside around the main castles is dotted with villages and towns, and there are way-stations constructed along the roads for questing knights, stocked with firewood and supplies. Stormcutter Mountain , a mountain carved with a massive rift by Rowan Kenrith 's lightning. The boundary lands are a nebulous region between the Realm and the Wilds traversed by a cart road. Both humans and fae folk frequent these lands, trading with each other for coin. Hero's Rock' Orrinshire , a village that lies at a remote edge of the Realm. Yearly visits from a single traveling merchant serve as a holiday on their own. The village avoided both the Phyrexian Invasion and the Wicked Slumber. Orrinshire is best known for its wool, and there are at least five times as many sheep in the village as people. A homogeneous community, its human villagers avoid the fae and those associated with them. Tanglespan , a giant chasm between the Realm and the Wilds. Created outside Locthwain during New Phyrexia's Invasion of Eldraine to trap the invaders, it is crossed by a network of bridges and beanstalks. It is inhabited by fauns and trolls . Undertaker's Corner , a perilous section of road that looks out over an idyllic grange hundreds of feet below. Carts have been known to fly off the cliff instead of successfully making the sharp right turn to follow switchbacks down into the valley. The Wilds by Chris Seaman. The Wilds are an enchanted environment with shifting borders, where distance, direction, time, and the seasons all seem to be distorted and where both monsters and curses abound. The inhabitants of the Wilds are called the fair folk by the people of the Realm and include faeries, elves, merfolk known as undines, redcap goblins, reclusive human witches who practice dark magic against those they deem deserving, and those dwarves and giants who choose not to live in the Realm. The closest thing the Wilds have to a ruling body is a Council of Druids , elves who wish to return the plane to the days of elvish rule. Though mostly composed of vast woodland, the Wilds are dotted with crumbling forts and overgrown castles. At some point, the Wilds meet the ocean, though no other information about these shores is known. The heart land , with the ruins of the old crown city of the lost elven dominion. Four pyramids guarding its perimeter, each with a pair of obelisks on top. The Jade Bridge and the Obsidian Bridge , crossing the river that surrounds the heart realm. The Obsidian Bridge houses a deadly guardian. An amphitheater made out of the remains of a petrified dragon, where the Council of Druids meets. The Well of Ghosts The Bridge of Regrets Ashvale Bramblefort The forest on the Choking Drum Delirium Swamp , infested by brain-eating fungus . Dunbarrow , a misty marsh of twisted trees near Edgewall, near which Agatha 's cabin was. It is home to witches and giant spiders . Loch Larent , a popular lake for fishing in the farthest reaches of Dunbarrow, a week's journey from Edgewall. Home to merfolk led by Sharae , it was frozen when the witch Hylda built her palace above it. Eerie blue lights bob and weave beneath the frozen surface of the lake. It likely melted after Hylda's power waned. Winter's Home , Hylda's ice castle. The main tower stands on a rocky cliff overlooking the loch. The road to the castle is paved with glittering crystal gravel, and a pile of bodies at the outermost drawbridge marks the point most adventurers fell. A series of five portcullises lead to successive fortresses with seemingly never-ending walls and drawbridges leading to nowhere. After Hylda relinquished her crown, the castle began to melt. Dynnistan , a castle in the remote outer wilds far from the Realm, ruled by the Shadow Queen . Faeburrow The haunted glade at the fringe of the Wilds. Where the Kenrith twins were born and sacrificed. The Witch's Cottage The Witching Well Malice Rocks Maraleaf Forest Mistford Mosswood Oakhame , an elven settlement Ogre's Pass Red Fell , home of Torbran Redtooth Keep , one of the last evlen citadels. Home to elves that were cursed to become werefoxes . The curse was later broken by Syr Armont . Sweettooth Village , an abandoned village overrun with Food horrors . Tuinvale , the home of the High Fae deep within the wilds. Talion's court is a palace of hewed stone. Its ground is covered in cool moss and silver grass. The mind-bending structures of the court shift and glimmer as if translucent, and vary from thatched houses the size of mountains to miniature castles populated by miniature knights. Atop a staircase, Talion's glittering throne room within smells of perfume, while the throne itself is shrouded in shadow. Its twisted trees bear jeweled fruit. Adventurers are invited to speak to a High Fae by the appearance of an archway made of ethereal, translucent stone. Wintermoor The Wildwood Concept art of the Kingdom of Storms. The Kingdom of Storms is a kingdom of storm giants situated above the Wilds. A land of cottages, keeps, and towers spread across islands of magical cloud, it can only be reached by climbing massive beanstalks known as Everstalks. Besides its ruling storm giants, its inhabitants include other giant creatures such as geese, oxen , and elemental elk known as tempest harts. Stormkeld , a massive marble castle in the clouds. Home to the Giant Beluna and current location of Indrelon . When Beluna's pet Beanstalk Wurms escape the castle and plant themselves in the ground below, they are known to destroy villages, forming new Everstalks. Long ago, the elves ruled the Realm. According to the humans, they were proud, arrogant, vain, and cruel, and they allowed any sort of magic to flourish unchecked. The elves asserted that those who were too weak to defend themselves should bend the knee to those more powerful in exchange for protection. Eight or nine generations before the Wildered Quest, mankind rose and overthrew the Elven Lords that had enslaved them, and the five knightly courts were created. Each court was established around a relic of tremendous magical power and unknown origin. Some elves remained at Locthwain rather than withdraw with their brethren into the Wilds after the elven courts lost their hold on the Realm. Generations before the Kenriths' High Quest, the rulers of Castle Ardenvale turned their magic to petty, selfish, wicked purposes and betrayed the virtues they purported to uphold. Many spurs of the Wilds were able to grow back into the countryside where they\u2019d been eradicated long ago. Unsavory magic was left unchecked. Ogres and dragons rampaged and destroyed as they pleased because no two towns could agree to a joint effort to fend them off. Witches roamed wherever they wished and cursed people with evil gifts and terrible afflictions. The Wild Hunt rode through the Wilds. After a two-generation-long interregnum, the Questing Beast chose the humble Algenus Kenrith and Linden to quest for the high rulership and gave each a sword as the mark of its favor. While Algenus completed the High Quest and became High King, Linden had to interrupt hers to save the lives of his children, Rowan and Will. After she married Algenus, she took them in as her children. The Realm became far more peaceful and orderly now that a High King ruled. Once he'd achieved the high rulership, Algenus hung up the gilded sword gifted to him by the Questing Beast and settled down to the less glamorous but more difficult task of ruling. The courts cooperated because there was a single ruler to coordinate and administrate, but Ardenvale was still fighting to recover what was lost. Queen Linden had been working to improve relations between the five courts but noticed increasing activity and hostility in the Wilds. It turned out that a malevolent planeswalker was stirring the non-humans up. After the High King was abducted by Oko , the fey, around 4561 AR and turned into a stag , Queen Linden struggled to hold the courts together. The Wilds were getting bolder, but with Algenus gone, the courts weren't coordinating their efforts to fight the rising tide of attacks. Meanwhile, Queen Ayara took another route and sent an envoy into the Wilds to negotiate with the Council of Druids. When the royal twins turned eighteen, they set out on a quest to find their father. The confrontation between the Realm and the Wilds culminated during the Wild Hunt at the location of the witch's cottage where the twins had been born and briefly killed by their birth mother. At the cottage, the stag was killed and the Wild Hunt was brought to its ritual end. As the dead stag returned to the form of Algenus Kenrith, his wife was able to return him to life with the aid of his magical sword which at that time had been hidden in the well. Learning the truth of their past, the Kenrith twins' shared Planeswalker's spark ignited, sending them across the Blind Eternities to a new plane. Eldraine was part of New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse . Within days of the Invasion, the courts of the Realm had fallen, the Kenriths were dead, and Ayara had been compleated , along with her guards. Yorvo was able to escape his court's devastation. Much of the surviving populace of the courts fled into the Wilds. While Eldraine's resistance opened a massive chasm outside Locthwain , Torbran was tasked with luring the Phyrexians into the trap. Rankle inadvertently brought the plan to fruition just as the Phyrexians fell under the Wicked Slumber . Main article: Wicked Slumber Talion , the fae Lord of the Wilds, along with the three witch sisters Agatha , Eriette , and Hylda , had cast the Wicked Slumber on the plane to halt the Invasion. However, the curse did not lift after the Invasion's conclusion, but instead began to spread to the plane's living inhabitants. Ashiok took advantage of this slumber to use the inhabitants' nightmares against those still awake, while the Kenrith twins, having lost their shared spark , pursued differing methods in reuniting the realms. Will Kenrith took up his father's crown, declaring himself High King of the Realm, while Rowan sought magical power to regain control. The half-Fae Kellan was quested by Fae Lord Talion to defeat the three witches and lift the curse. Kellan, with the help of Ruby , succeeded in killing Agatha and defeating Hylda. Rowan was coerced by Eriette, whose powers had grown through the meddling of the planeswalker Ashiok . Kellan, along with Will, who was able to unite knights from across the realm, defeated the villains and captured Eriette, ending the curse and reawakening the realm. Some knights who survived the invasion have forsaken what remains of their courts. Knights from all five courts joined to form the Verdant Order , renouncing their former oaths and swearing to defend the last untouched parts of the wilds. To that end, they patrol the forests along the Boundary Lands, turning back loggers and hunters. Though they've renounced their former oaths, the knights of the Verdant Order retain their focus on the five virtues of the courts. Many of Locthwain 's survivors now operate as mercenaries or knights errant and no longer feel bound to their chivalric code. It is rumored that those seeking out the Cauldron of Eternity now do so to reverse the devastation suffered during the Invasion.
