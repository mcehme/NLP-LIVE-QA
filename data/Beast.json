{"text": "Beast is a catch-all creature type used for large, monstrous, animal-like creatures. The first creature to bear the type was Beasts of Bogardan in Legends (though the Clockwork Beast from Alpha and Guardian Beast from Arabian Nights were later issued errata to become beasts), but it wasn't until Tempest that the \"beast\" subtype attained widespread usage. Later, in the Odyssey and Onslaught blocks , \"beast\" became a common \" tribe \" with considerable inter-card support. In the Grand Creature Type Update the creature types Carnivore ( Tooth and Claw ), Lurker ( Lurker ), Villain ( Spinal Villain ) and Frostbeast ( Kjeldoran Frostbeast ) were changed into Beast. On the other hand Glowing Anemone was changed from Beast to Anemone , while later reverting to Beast and gaining the added Jellyfish type. Warthog shortly was a Beast ( Warthog ) before being turned into a Boar . Herbivorous Beasts form one of the dominant clades of Ikoria and are mainly associated with the lush forests of Zagoth . Most of them resemble large herbivores \u2014 elk , rhinos , camels , boars , and the like \u2014 but it is dangerous to conclude that they are at all docile. Even smaller beast monsters are territorial and irascible, liable to stampede or trample when they are alarmed or threatened. These Beasts have many telltale traits: shaggy hides, thick skin, antlers and tusks, stumpy feet or hooves, etc. While most are large and lumbering, there are also many smaller, graceful beasts that more closely resemble horses or antelopes . When Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths had a strong tribal theme in vision design , Beasts were the green -centered tribe. Beast of Burden is not a Beast. Krosan Warchief is a Beast Lord . Gruul Keyrune is a manstone that can become a 3/2 red and green Beast artifact creature with trample. Hidden Predators is a Enchantment that can become a 4/4 green Beast. Often referred to by the community as \" booster ruiners \", Trained Orgg 's and Vizzerdrix 's foil versions came to grow into valuable and coveted collector cards - partially because of the meme, partially because of the nostalgia. They also have grown to be probably some of most famous Beast-type creatures in the game. As of March 2022, the prices for these cards ranged from $80USD to $160USD according to MTGGoldfish - while in E-Bay they were being sold for as high as $120USD to $265USD."}
