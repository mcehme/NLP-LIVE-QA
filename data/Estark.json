{"text": "Estark is the high barony and city of the land of Kush . Estark is primarily known for its annual Festival of the Arena , which took place every year and served as the primary reckoning. Originally there were five Houses in Kush which governed each district. The master of the house dwelt in their respective house's palace and was responsible for overseeing that house's retinue of magic fighters, who resided in chapter houses throughout the Western Realm . Each house wore a different color. Originally, the Festival was a ritual conducted privately by magic fighters wishing to test their skill. Under Kuthuman , an arena was constructed and the Festival became a public sporting event. Fighting was governed by sessan (a code of chivalry among magic fighters) and used for gaining power, honor, and face. The last evening of the 978th Festival, the Night of Fire occurred, on which Zarel Ewine led a massacre of the House Oor-tael , joined by the other four houses. Kuthuman immediately capitalized on the massacre to ascend . Zarel became the new Grand Master, and he turned the games into a blood sport. The ultimate winner of each Festival was promised the opportunity to serve Kuthuman, though he secretly euthanized each one to prevent them become a threat to his own survival.
