{"text": "The Conclave of Mages was an impressive citadel, built on the site of the Monastery of Gix on Dominaria during the Dark Age . The school or its predecessor was founded between 69 and 80 AR by Tawnos and Ashnod to study both artifice and magic. It was later surrounded by the Maze of Ith , and Lord Ith would claim that he was the founder of the place. The Conclave, which was located on Terisiare , was an alternate to the City of Shadows in Lat-Nam as a refuge for persecuted mages, but was much less structured. It was destroyed by a combination of a surprise attack by the Church of Tal , and Lord Ith's rage at his imprisonment in the citadel, after which most of its denizens travelled to the City of Shadows.
