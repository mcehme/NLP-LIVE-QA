{"text": "Razaketh was one of the four demons who dealt with Liliana Vess following the Mending . From him, Liliana gained sway over the living. Razaketh is one of the strongest demons Liliana Vess made a pact with. He was located on Amonkhet , where he guarded the Gate to the Afterlife for Nicol Bolas . Razaketh begins the Hour of Devastation After the Second Sun had come to rest between Bolas' Horn Monument, the Gates of the Afterlife opened and Razaketh stood revealed before the population of Naktamun, much to their horror and dismay. At the demon's command, the Luxa turned to blood, while he uttered a challenge to Liliana. Using a hidden clause in their contract, Razaketh managed to take control over Liliana's body, calling her towards him. He toyed with her until he was intercepted by the Gatewatch , who surprised him enough that she managed to free herself. Using her necromantic magic to take control over the dead beasts in the Luxa, she tore him apart and let her undead feast on his remains. Associated cards: Depicted in: Magic Duels"}
