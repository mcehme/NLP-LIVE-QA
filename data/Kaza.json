{"text": "Kaza is a human thrill seeker and master wizard from Zendikar . She is a member of the Sea Gate Expeditionary House . Kaza is a small, cheerful, woman who carries a large carved staff, and has a mischievous twinkle in her eye. She can levitate objects but specializes in explosions and destruction. She looks down on more indirect magic and believes that bigger is better. She's also a bit of a tinker and was able to cobble together a flying wizard's staff from technology she found in the Skyclaves . In the clash with the Eldrazi , Kaza fought together with Akiri , Zareth San and Orah . She claims to have destroyed an entire Eldrazi brood with a handful of spells and one well-placed exploding vial. She involved herself with the Sea Gate restoration efforts after Zareth and Akiri saved her from an elemental attack. She was shocked to find out how well she got along with her teammates and would do anything to protect them. After the defeat of the Eldrazi, Kaza and her three friends were hired by Nahiri to accompany her to the Murasa Skyclave to find the Lithoform Core . After the discovery of the Core, Elementals attacked and Kaza and Orah were separated from the rest of the party . Akiri later located them with the help of Jace Beleren . After Zendikar became a target in New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Commander Tazri had a halo-infused vision. She sent Akiri, Linvala, Kaza, and Orah to Emeria , where they witnessed the return of the compleated Nahiri . Joined by Tazri, the party attacked the planeswalker in the heart of Emeria's transformed Skyclave . Though Nahiri at first gained the upper hand with ease, the fight turned as the angels of New Capenna entered the Multiverse and gave angels everywhere access to Halo . With Linvala's newfound strength, and Tazri's halo, the party managed to break Nahiri loose from the reformed Hedron network and knock her from her feet. As they escaped, they witnessed the Skyclave breaking and crashing to the ground with Nahiri still inside."}
