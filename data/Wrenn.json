{"text": "Wrenn was a dryad planeswalker introduced in Modern Horizons . Her homeplane is currently unknown. Wrenn is a dryad who can symbiotically bind with a Treefolk . Like all Dryads, she will die without a host after a prolonged period. Unlike other dryads, who are born with their respective trees, grow in tandem with them and never leave them, Wrenn can move from tree to tree. She speaks with a low and gently pitched voice, with rounded vowels that match no known accent. Her skin is pale and her hair is long, loose, and even whiter, bone-bleached and stark. Wrenn gained access to red mana by trapping within herself the fire that destroyed her home glade, causing her chest to glow red hot and inadvertently expanding her bonding beyond the norm of her race. Wrenn cannot planeswalk without a host, but it is her spark that allows it. She cannot bond with any normal tree, but only to one whose song she hears, which is strong enough to contain the fire within her. She treats her hosts as allies, refusing to see them as tools or as mere means to an end. When a host grows weak, she takes it to the spot to which it wishes to return as a tree before seeking another. Without Wrenn, her treefolk symbiotes can't planeswalk. Although living organic material ordinarily can't be brought along on a planeswalk, Wrenn's power to carry treefolk with her breaks this rule (comparable to Yanggu 's ability to planeswalk with Mowu ). Wrenn is primarily green -aligned but secondarily red . Wrenn retains dryad nature magic, being able to fuse with trees and understand them. She gained access to pyromancy after containing a forest fire within herself and can use it offensively. Finally, she is capable of some sort of metamagic, allowing her to feel and perceive spells. Wrenn's spark ignited when a forest fire threatened the lives of her sisters. She contained the fire within herself, but at a heavy cost: she'd have to share it (and presumably her planeswalker spark) with a tree or she'd be consumed from the inside. As a dryad , Wrenn needs to be \"hosted\" to a tree. However, not all trees can support Wrenn's \"flames,\" and those she can bond with cannot survive the process for long. After the ignition of her spark, Wrenn found her first (named by her One ) host on her homeworld. This made it possible for her to planeswalk through the multiverse . With Teferi 's help, Wrenn finds Seven in Kessig ( Innistrad ). Respecting her trees' wishes, she cycles through them. Four, Six, and Seven have come from Kessig , which planeswalkers claim to have the finest trees in the multiverse . Wrenn agrees, even if she doesn't particularly like Innistrad itself. After she left Six to live out his remaining days as a mighty yet ordinary oak, she began searching for her new host. Following the whispering song of a young sapling, she was intercepted by Teferi . Teferi sought to learn what the \"white witch\" was that some residents had seen and immediately recognized her as another planeswalker. Due to an encounter with a malevolent entity, Teferi was forced to create a time spell, which was corrupted and led them to walk around in circles. Nearly dying, Wrenn offered to grant insight into metamagic, allowing Teferi to see the spell and undo it. Unknown to him, there was one beneficial effect remaining. Wrenn's sapling had gathered all the time it could contain. Afterward, Wrenn met a now fully grown Seven . In gratitude for Teferi's help, she promised him to help undo Zhalfir 's phasing, but not before showing Seven around the multiverse as the tree had requested. Meeting again on Cridhe , Wrenn was recruited by Teferi to join the fight against the Phyrexians. They gathered on Dominaria , visiting Jamuraa before settling in Urza's Tower . Wrenn and Seven helped Nissa Revane fend off the second line of Phyrexians attacking the tower and the Temporal Anchor held within. After the battle, she stayed behind with Jodah and Saheeli Rai to help recover Teferi from the damaged stasis coffin  of the Temporal Anchor . Wrenn and Eight . Wrenn wasn't part of the planeswalker strike force that set out to destroy Realmbreaker on New Phyrexia . Together with Vivien , Chandra , and Liliana , she took refuge in one of the latter's cabins on Dominaria and anxiously awaited the return of the team. When the survivors returned, they were devastated to learn what had happened. Defiant, Chandra was the only one of the group willing to return to New Phyrexia to help their remaining allies. The group tried to dissuade her, but she decided to go anyway. Wrenn, who had stayed silent, joined her and told her she had the plan to merge with the Invasion Tree, hoping to use it to retrieve Teferi to help them. Traveling to New Phyrexia, Chandra, Wrenn, and Seven met with Koth and Urabrask who brought them to Realmbraker. Here, they were stopped by the compleated Nissa Revane , who tore Seven apart limb from limb. Now without legs, Chandra, Koth, and the remaining Mirrans in valiant effort carried Wrenn to Realmbreaker . Wrenn was able to bond with Realmbreaker, whom she named Eight. Together, they located Zhalfir and Teferi and swapped the location of New Phyrexia with Zhalfir . The effort and strain of this act caused the fire Wrenn contained within herself to burn bright, killing the dryad and causing her form to turn into an ashen statue. What remained was a single acorn, picked up by Teferi Akosa and planted on Zhalfir. The acorn sprouted quickly, nurtured by the five suns that now orbit Zhalfir. Wrenn was able to bond with Realmbreaker . In the video game Magic: The Gathering Arena , Wrenn is voiced by Tara Langella. Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
