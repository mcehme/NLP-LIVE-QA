{"text": "The Planeswalker War was a tremendous, yet mysterious war that took place on Corondor following the events in Wayfarer , shortly before the Phyrexian Invasion (4195 AR to 4205 AR). The war was triggered by Ravidel , but included such powerful planeswalkers as Leshrac , Tevesh Szat , Kristina , Jared Carthalion , Grenfell Mor , Ash Warlord Embereck , Geyadrone Dihada , and Sandruu , and probably many more. Dakkon Blackblade was not one of the primary planeswalkers in this war. Though the outcome of the war is unknown, it is certain that Leshrac , Tevesh Szat , Kristina , Jared Carthalion and Geyadrone Dihada all survived. Grenfell Mor and Embereck were killed, while Ravidel and Sandruu 's fates are unknown. Corondor was impacted for centuries by the war. Little is known about the Planeswalker War, due to the cancellation of Magic's line of comic books . Some characters from that conflict have yet to appear in any other novels or storylines, leading many to speculate that these characters may have perished in the war. However, this is mere speculation. Among storyline fans, the Planeswalker War is one of the most-discussed storylines that never came about."}
