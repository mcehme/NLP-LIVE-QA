{"text": "Cat is a creature type used for felines. In Magic , the term refers to both regular cats and other feline creatures (some endowed with sapience), such as lions and tigers. The first creature to bear the type was Cat Warriors in Legends (though the Savannah Lions from Alpha was later issued errata to become a Cat). The first card with the subtype Cat without a second subtype was Canyon Wildcat from Tempest . Cats come in all colors , but are primarily found in green and white . Cat warriors are feline humanoids found throughout Dominaria , primarily on the continent of Jamuraa . There are various strains of cat warriors, some resembling tigers, others leopards or jaguars, and yet others cougars. The cat warriors have kept a relatively low profile throughout Dominaria's history, but they date back at least as far as the era of the Thran Empire . There are various tribes of cat warriors. The Chitr\u2019in were visited by Gerrard Capashen and Mirri once. The Efravans , Hooraree , Khyyiani , and Sulaki live in the Sukurvian Desert . After the Phyrexian Invasion of Dominaria destroyed the cat warriors' Jamuraan homelands, their race was scattered across Dominaria. The panther warriors, nacatl, leonin, and perhaps nishoba as well, might be considered to belong to the same race as other cat warriors, but their cultures are distinct enough to set them apart. Dominarian catfolk, as a whole, appear to have become extinct, except for the panther warriors of Free Urborg . The panther warriors are exiles of the cat warrior nations, many of whom had taken up residence in Urborg . They sometimes serve dark forces but are usually neutral in their worldview. During the Mirage Wars , they were led by Purraj , an ally of Kaervek , who came with him to Jamuraa from Urborg and possibly perished there. Long after the demise of Lord Windgrace , his followers still defended Urborg by sabotaging the Cabal 's artifacts. Organized in Free Urborg, they were led by Marivel . Leonin are a form of anthropomorphic lion found on multiple planes. They have a strong connection to white mana. The Leonin of Mirrodin dwelled in the Razor Fields , their capital being Taj-Nar , the Ancient Den . Their culture is highly honor-based and religious, worshipping the white sun. Clerics of the suns have to survive a year in the Razor Fields before they are regarded as full abunas ( clerics ) that are allowed to lead other Leonin in religious ceremonies, particularly the Sunroar. As with all creatures from Mirrodin, they have partially metallic features. The Leonin shared a bond with the pterons, flying reptiles, and specialized skyhunters who used them as mounts. After Memnarch was defeated and Karn , Mirrodin's creator, sent those leonin abducted from other planes back to where they had come from, a schism ran through the remaining ones. One group supported a new kha named Kemba, calling themselves the kha-tal. The other, formerly the Obu-tal, called for a revolution against the old societal structures, believing that they did not apply to the changing world. Like all inhabitants of Mirrodin, the leonin were drawn to that world from another plane. Though never explicitly stated, it is possible that they came from Alara ; both the nacatl and the leonin call their leader the kha , and after Alara reformed, some Nacatl began calling themselves Leonin. The nacatl are a race of leonin from the shard of Naya (originally part of Alara ). The males look very similar to the leonin of Mirrodin (sans metal plating) and have light fur, while the females lack manes. Naya's leonin display more physiological variety than Mirrodin's leonin; Nacatl have coats like tigers, jaguars, ocelots, and others, ranging from mottled-jaguar to silver-gray to completely black. The cat-people used to dominate Naya, with the nacatl's Empire of the Clouds operating an extensive system of roads, bridges, and aqueducts across the plane \u2014 all constructed out of rocks and timbers so finely cut that mortar was unnecessary. During the years of the empire, the Nacatl didn\u2019t have a spiritual culture. The Nacatl embraced a code of ethics called the Coil in which each was free to pursue happiness however they wanted as long as they didn't hurt another Nacatl. A rebellious faction known as the Claws of Marisi believed they had grown weak, and that they should return to their true cat nature. Their empire crumbled and the nacatl were reduced to isolated tribes. By the time of the Conflux, the nacatl were split into at least two cultural groups: the peaceful Cloud Nacatl , who inhabited the mountain ruins of their ancestors, and the violent Wild Nacatl and Claws of Marisi, who lived in the lowland jungles; the two groups had nothing but contempt for each other. Scratchforms is the writing system employed by the nacatl. Among Wild Nacatl, scratchforms are predominantly used by shamans . The most important text set in scratchforms was the Coil. Most Nacatl have returned to wandering the cloud jungles and grow more feral with each generation. Many have returned to a mainly nocturnal existence, sleeping in low branches during the day and doing most of their hunting in the early evening. Starstalkers are the most skilled hunters of the Wild Nacatl and are highly respected for their physical prowess. Many nomadic tribes camp in the ruins of their former civilization. Because of fewer resources in the high jungles, the Nacatl have begun wandering into the lower elevations, where they fight both elves and humans over territory. The Nacatl social unit is the pride. Among the Cloud Nacatl, prides are longstanding and complex familial structures with their own great histories and bloodlines. The Wild Nacatl, however, have prides that are looser and more changeable. Each pride has a leader, though individuals within the pride generally have the freedom to do as they wish. Leadership and status are determined through ferocity and survival rather than blood ties. While stonework is used in the construction of roads and large buildings, the Nacatl prefer to live in drays: small, stone-hewn dens built around tree trunks and in cliff faces. The Nacatl-like baskets and reed weaving, and decorate their drays with remnants of their warrior past, like old shields, weapons, and exquisite tusk carvings. Celebration and wealth are highly prized among the Nacatl. The savage nacatl are a subgroup of which very little is known, save that they disdain the use of weapons and armor. Savage nacatl are larger and more muscular than other cat-people, with no manes, gray fur, and black tiger-like stripes. Their relation to other nacatl is unknown. After the Conflux, when Alara was made whole once more, some nacatl migrated to the civilized lands of Bant and began integrating into the city-dwelling culture. The Bant cat-people, who adapted to the chivalrous code of knights and soldiers, simply called themselves leonin. The Nayan pride of the Sunstrikers is loyal to Ajani . It's their sworn duty to keep his and their lands safe. Nacatl means 'Meat' in Nahuatl, which is a Mesoamerican language notably used by the Aztecs. Unlike the proud leonin of other planes, Theros ' leonin are disgraced outcasts due to their previous support of the Archon Agnomakhos , who tyrannized Meletis and surrounding lands. These leonin make a conscious effort to separate themselves from humanity and the other races, down to not worshipping the main gods of Theros, though some do still occasionally honor Heliod and Nylea . Most live in the golden plain of Oreskos . Each year, on the day of the first full moon after the autumn equinox, matriarchs from all the leonin prides gather at Tethmos to select a monarch, who acts as a representative of the pride in the wider world. On Capenna , the leonin are mostly associated with the Cabaretti crime family, although they are also present in the Brokers . Uniquely they more closely resemble domestic cats and caracal rather than lions. Ogre -sized cat-people blending the features of snow leopards and smilodons, nishobas lived as marauders in cold regions. Nishobas are known to have lived in Terisiare and Otaria . Endemic to Tarkir , these anthropomorphic cats are also demons . Tiger-like in appearance, they are associated with the Sultai Brood , the members of the brood having made demonic contracts with them to gain power. They wield potent dark magic that makes them feared. A single Rakshasa can lay waste to swaths of land or reduce an army to dust. They summon horrors and abominations that swallow cities and devour legions. In the past, Tasigur , khan of the Sultai, offended the rakshasa, who withdrew their support from him. Having been left vulnerable to the renewed dragon attacks, Tasigur made a pact with Silumgar , leading him to a meeting with the other khans. Afterward, the rakshasa renewed their pacts, but this time with Silumgar. The dragonlord fears that the rakshasa will eventually turn against him, but knows that their magic is too useful for him.

Once it has the scent, it hunts down its prey to the end. The Zendikar continent of Sejiri is home to felidars, ferocious horned cat beasts . Some human knights are able to tame them . Felidars that make it through their first year of life can easily live to see a hundred years more. Certain felidars are believed to have become isolated from the skyclaves , where over time they became the monstrous shadowcats that now inhabit them. Felidars are also found on Kaladesh , where they are kept as guard beasts , and on Ikoria . Felidars are also found on Ravnica , where they are primarily associated with the Azorius Guild where they form strong bonds with a single individual, sometimes a criminal, allowing them to see through their eyes and find them anywhere on the plane. Some Ravnican Felidars are winged. Winged Felidars with access to magic serve as bonded mounts for the plane's Archons . Firecats are elemental cats native to the Pardic Mountains of Otaria. As their name suggests, their bodies are permanently ablaze. Their extinguished furs were often used as clothing by the Pardic barbarians. In Ikoria , cats are one of the dominant clades and in particular oversee Savai . They are elegant but sadistic predators that toy with their prey. Like all life on Ikoria, they are mutants and several have wings, which Vivien Reid remarks as not being seen as unusual there. A variety of cats native to Indatha as opposed to Savai. They glow. Jhovalls are enormous cats native to Mercadia . They are fierce in combat and are large and strong enough to be used as mounts for fully-armored warriors, although training to ride the beasts takes many years of practice. Jhovall rider s, therefore, make up the elite corps of both the Mercadian and Cho-Arrim armies. Leotau (LEE-oh-tau ) are semi-intelligent mounts employed by the Inner Three nations of Bant , distantly related to the leonin of Naya. They are unique in that they are hooved animals; they have the heads and bodies of lions, but possess the legs of horses or bulls. Leotau prefer the shard's inland savannahs and have a notorious dislike of the ocean and coastal areas. Neither Jhess nor Valeron use the leotau for this reason. There are three distinct leotau subspecies: the white-coated orisil favored by the Blessed caste; the golden, fleet-footed mherva; and the large, calico/dappled grohm. Undead variants of these species are present in Grixis . Giant, six-eyed cats on Ravnica , loyal to the Gruul .
