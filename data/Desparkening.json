{"text": "The event as depicted in Spark Rupture . The Desparkening , Great Desparking , or Great Desparkening , was a process that caused the vast majority of planeswalkers across the Multiverse to lose their sparks following the end of New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse . The Desparkening caused a gradual fading of the spark from planeswalkers' bodies, leaving them without the ability to enter the Blind Eternities and travel between planes. How quickly the process took is unknown but it appears to have been subtle enough that some planeswalkers didn't notice the change until they attempted to planeswalk. It has been stated that the energy that made up the sparks still exists, and that they may have left their hosts rather than disappearing altogether. Although the spark is intrinsically connected to a being's soul, it is confirmed that the desparked planeswalkers retained their souls. In contrast to other methods of spark removal (e.g. Nicol Bolas 's Elderspell ), the Desparkening was not lethal. The Desparkening began after New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse in 4562 AR . The exact cause and mechanics of the Desparkening are unknown, but Teferi speculated that the Multiverse may have been attempting to heal itself in response to Elspeth 's detonation of the Filigree Sylex within the Blind Eternities and the chaos caused by Wrenn and Realmbreaker 's successful New Phyrexia-Zhalfir switch . Planeswalkers that lost their sparks were subsequently trapped on their current plane. Many planeswalkers participated in the defense of their home planes during New Phyrexia's Invasion, relegating them to their original planes. However, some planeswalkers retained their sparks, and thus their ability to travel between planes at will. Around the same time, Omenpaths opened throughout the Multiverse, allowing both planeswalkers and non-planeswalkers to travel the Multiverse for the first time since the Great Mending . It is unknown if these Omenpaths are due to the Desparkening itself, or if they are a residual effect of Realmbreaker opening portals across the Multiverse. Karn sacrificed the spark he inherited from Venser to un-compleat Ajani Goldmane and Nissa Revane . Nahiri 's spark ended up encased in a hedron after her un-compleation, but it was lost when the hedron shattered. A cracked planeswalker symbol represents those who have lost their spark. Multiple former planeswalkers received new cards as Legendary Creatures in March of the Machine: The Aftermath . Each featured a cracked planeswalker symbol watermark . Desparked former planeswalkers' first appearance as legendary creatures in future sets will feature the same watermark. It as yet unknown if desparked planeswalkers who never received a Planeswalker card will feature the watermark. Head designer Mark Rosewater announced that, beginning with Wilds of Eldraine , sets would feature only one Planeswalker card. Referred to:"}
