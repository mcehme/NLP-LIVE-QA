{"text": "The Order of Stromgald was a political movement in Kjeldor , during the Ice Age of Dominaria . It took its name from the legendary Kjeldoran general M\u00e1rton Stromgald . On the surface, the Order of Stromgald appeared to be a concerned party that feared the weakened will of Kjeldor's king, Darien . However, under the surface, the Order had more malign roots. The Order was formed by former Kjeldoran knight Avram Garrison and the necromancer and archenemy of the people of Kjeld, Lim-D\u00fbl . The true intent of the Order of Stromgald was to assassinate Darien and weaken the political structure of Kjeld, hastening Lim-D\u00fbl's victory over the already assaulted nation. The Order eventually fell apart after the defeat of Lim-D\u00fbl, but various factions that were rumored to exist probably merged with his surviving undead army at Tresserhorn . The Order used huge war steeds which sometimes could fly ( Stromgald Crusader ). The Order's crest was a flaming phoenix . Their cause was \"Kjeldor for Kjeldorans!\" An ethno-nationalist movement, they believed elves, dwarves, and Balduvians to be abominations. Quoted or referred to:"}
