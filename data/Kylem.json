{"text": "Kylem is a plane featured in the Battlebond set. Kylem is inspired by sports and games. On this world, beings flock from all over the plane to the arena of Valor's Reach , where two-on-two combat is the pinnacle of sport. The goal of the combatants isn't to kill their opponents outright, but to defeat them with style and flair, using spells and spectacles that make the crowd go wild. Kylem was designed specifically for Battlebond . It's not a very fleshed out world, making its use anywhere but Battlebond 2 rather tricky. Cloudspire City , with its famous stadium, Valor's Reach , its training center and its hot springs. The Vault of Champions , in which victors are commemorated and moments of glory immortalized. Various other smaller stadiums across the plane.
