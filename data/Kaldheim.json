Bundle featuring Kaya key art The planeswalker Kaya visits a world of prophecy and legend, mortals and monsters . A world of many realms, epic sagas , bound by one truth. Viking or Valkyrie , Elf or Dwarf , all belong to the World Tree , all are supplicant to the gods . Gods who travel between the realms to do their bidding for peace, for bloodshed, or for their own amusement. But what if there was a way to harness this power? A weapon with the ability to protect all . A weapon of pure strength. Forged for a god. Or... in more creative hands , a weapon of unimaginable chaos. The World Tree is the origin of all life on Kaldheim , and you can see the branches in the sky in all ten realms. However, they look different in each realm. The Ten Realms are constantly shifting and moving around the World Tree and can even collide. Such an epic event is called a \" doomskar \" and causes earthquakes, destabilization, and total chaos.

Emblem for Tibalt, Cosmic Impostor . Emblem for Tyvar Kell . Foretell marker. Foretell helper card Kaldheim has a tribal theme. Each Realm is associated with two colors of magic and one creature type, with a particular strategy associated: : Spirits , foretell control : Zombies , snow midrange : Demons and Berserkers , boast aggro : Trolls , ramp : Humans , tokens : Angels , \"pseudo- surge \" : Giants , \"spells matter\" and Giant tribal : Elves , self- mill and Elf tribal : Dwarves , Vehicles and Equipment : Shapeshifters , changeling / \"choose a creature type\" tribal In lieu of the abandoned block model, R&D has found a new way to tie together the three non-core premier sets in a single Magic \"year\" (aka the fall, winter, and spring sets\u2014using northern hemisphere seasons): they share a common mechanic. For Zendikar Rising , Kaldheim and Strixhaven: School of Mages that is modal double-faced cards . Modal double-faced cards have two faces, one on each side. When you play a modal double-faced card, you choose the face you're playing. The nonland MDFC's of Kaldheim all feature a legendary God creature on one side and a legendary permanent on the other. A returning mechanic is changeling , which is used to make a cohesive set (like it was used in Lorwyn and Modern Horizons previously). Changeling is a characteristic-defining ability that grants the object it\u2019s on every creature type. The mechanic is again tied to shapeshifters . A new mechanic is foretell . During your turn, you may pay and exile a card with foretell from your hand face down . You may cast it on a later turn for its foretell cost. Each card with foretell has a raven watermark , alluding to Hakka . Another new mechanic is boast . Boast adds a drawback to an activated ability which is referred as the boast ability . The drawback is as follows: a player can only activate the boast ability after the creature with the ability attacks and at most once each turn. Poison counters appear for the first time since the Scars of Mirrodin block as a one-off, on Fynn, the Fangbearer . Similarly, keyword counters reappear since their introduction in Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths , specifically flying counters ( Ascendant Spirit , Ascent of the Worthy ) and indestructible counters ( Tyrite Sanctum ). An unnamed mechanic, dubbed \" Cremate \", uses creature cards in the graveyard as a resource . Another theme is that several cards have triggered abilities that trigger whenever you cast your second spell in a turn. Kaldheim sees the second return of the Saga enchantment subtype , after appearances in Dominaria and Theros Beyond Death . They are multicolored for the first time. The supertype Snow also returns, and this time on non-permanents. Snow doesn't really do anything by itself, but it can be referred to by other cards in various ways. Snow cards now have their own recognizable snow frame . Each Draft Booster will include a Snow basic land slot and has a chance to be foil. There is a chance for one of the dual snow lands to take the Snow land slot. The set introduces the Rune and Shard enchantment types. Additionally, the set introduces the Niko and Tyvar planeswalker types , and the Phyrexian creature type on a surprise appearance of Vorinclex . Coward finally appears as a creature type on the card, Craven Hulk . Viking was considered as a creature type, but R&D decided against it. Instead, Viking-esque creatures have the creature type Warrior or Berserker . Supporting party from the previous set, classes represented are either Berserker or one of the party, and appear more on usually classless races like Angels, Demons, Zombies and Trolls.

Alrund, God of the Cosmos was accidentally printed without the words \"revealed this way.\" Rampage of the Valkyries was missing the word \"creature\" in its first ability. Both Valkyrie Harbinger and Rampage of the Valkyries create regular non-Warrior Angel tokens. This was described as an \"oversight\", but their functionality remains as printed. Main article: Kaldheim/Commander decks Kaldheim features two Commander decks that are released as a regular part of a set's product line. Tibalt's Trickery , while intended as a high-risk high-reward counterspell for red, proved highly exploitable \u2014 players would counter their own spells in order to cheat expensive cards into play. Modern was the most vulnerable format for this exploit, thanks to cascade guaranteeing a hit, and thus a ban quickly ensued. The impact on Historic was minimal at first, but with the introduction of cascade to Arena via Jumpstart: Historic Horizons , Tibalt's Trickery decks came to dominate the Historic metagame. After several months, the card was banned from Historic. Months later, Explorer banned the card within weeks of the format's introduction. Alrund's Epiphany is similar to Nexus of Fate as an extra-turn spell that impacted Standard . It released to moderate success, due to the highly aggressive, tempo-based meta of the time that made a 6-7 mana spell a risky investment. This changed with the fall 2021 rotation knocking the tempo decks out of the meta, followed by the release of Galvanic Iteration in Innistrad: Midnight Hunt . The second half of 2021 saw a large share of blue/red control decks that sought to outlast the opponent long enough to cast and copy many Epiphanies, then kill them with the bird tokens. Despite similar decks comprising a majority of contenders at the 2021 World Championship , Wizards of the Coast declined to take action to diversify the metagame, stating that they would wait to see Innistrad: Crimson Vow ' s impact on the meta. Unfortunately, Crimson Vow only made things worse, augmenting extra-turns decks with Alchemist's Gambit and Hullbreaker Horror . With the creation of Alchemy , the card was nerfed in that format to A-Alrund's Epiphany , but the original card's tyranny over Standard remained until its ban on January 25, 2022. Faceless Haven was well-received for the first half of Kaldheim' s lifetime in Standard. In the Standard 2022 preview queue, it combined with The Book of Exalted Deeds to allow players to control a land that prevented them from losing, resulting in that card's temporary ban until rotation. As Alrund's Epiphany decks came to dominate the meta, monocolored aggro decks rose to oppose them, decks in which Faceless Haven proved problematic as a creature resistant to removal with a low opportunity cost. Faceless Haven was banned alongside Alrund's Epiphany in January 2022. Kaldheim Teaser \u2013 (Video). Magic: The Gathering . YouTube (December 17, 2020). Kaldheim Cinematic Trailer \u2013 (Video).
