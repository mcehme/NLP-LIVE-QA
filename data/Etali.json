{"text": "Etali , \"the hurricane,\" was an elder dinosaur from Ixalan . Etali was massive: magnitudes larger than the largest monstrosaur or dreadmaw. After his compleation , his lungs turned to engines that spat thunderheads from between his ribs, belching ink-black clouds from his core. Red lightning rippled up his shining, metal spine, pulsing with a heartbeat rhythm, increasing its cadence when Etali roared, building to a flash that blanketed the area in a crimson day. Waste heat vented from Etali with each breath, with the acidic smell of lightning and ozone. He bled dark oil and had a metal endoskeleton. During his fight with Zetalpa, his dorsal sail was torn by Zetalpa's talons, spines cracked and broken. Zacama subsequently bit off his arm and head. The opening of the golden city revealed the enormous elder dinosaurs , which were held in stasis during Orazca 's long hibernation in the earth. Each of these monsters embodies one aspect of the magic of the land: the sail-backed Etali is a manifestation of red mana and the unending rage of the storm. Etali was compleated by the green-aligned Copper Host during New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse and subsequently killed by Zacama during the defense of Orazca . Etali appears in mascot form in the trailer for Secret Lair: Just Add Milk ."}
