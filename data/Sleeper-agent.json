{"text": "A sleeper agent is a Phyrexian organism that is planted on a foreign plane , remaining inactive for a long period while establishing a secure position. The original sleeper agents were grown from harvested flesh stored within the Phyrexian flesh vats. They had no gender, were short (about the height of a child), and did not age. Called \" newts \" they were some of the most expendable forces ever created on Phyrexia. Many of the first newts were slain upon arrival to the planes they were to inhabit due to the differences which made them obvious to those they met. Later sleeper agents had a gender, naturally aged, and were usually unaware of their Phyrexian origin until the time they would be used for various chores, including the construction of portals to allow Phyrexians to enter other planes. They were never compleated . The best example of the latter type was Xantcha , a friend of Urza 's. Another one was Kerrick . New Phyrexia 's sleeper agents are compleated beings created by Sheoldred that are disguised as normal beings. They may be unaware that they have been altered. Their fleshy and metallic parts may burst out of their skin when they are exposed. Ajani Goldmane Kerrick Stenn Xantcha Associated cards: Depicted in: Referred to:"}
