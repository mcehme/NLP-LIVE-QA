{"text": "Hylda of the Icy Crown is a powerful witch from Eldraine . She is the sister of Agatha , Eriette , and an unnamed witch who was the birth mother of the Kenrith twins. Hylda's skin is pure white, and her nails are delicately pointed. She wears white finery and a crystal bracelet. She has the power to control ice and snow which is greatly enhanced when she wears her winter crown. She is aloof; unlike her sisters, she sought solitude rather than ambition. Hylda and her sisters Agatha and Eriette helped the faerie Talion cast the Wicked Slumber to end the Phyrexian Invasion of Eldraine . In exchange, Talion gave her the Icy Crown, which greatly enhanced her powers. After New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , she built her ice castle, Winter's Home, in the farthest reaches of Dunbarrow above Loch Larent. Her ice powers caused problems for the residents of the land and froze over the Loch, trapping the merfolk of Sharae beneath the ice. Multiple adventurers had tried and failed to defeat Hylda, before Kellan and Ruby came to the frozen kingdom searching for the icy crown. Kellan battled with Hylda's ice elemental guardians . At a critical moment, he discovered his ability to manifest weapons made from ethereal light. Forming a glowing blade, he struck the last elemental down but collapsed before he can reach Hylda. Ruby carried him nearly to the castle gates. Her act of selfishness convinced Hylda to relent and relinquish her crown. In a moment of kindness, Hylda kisses Kellan's forehead. With her blessing, Kellan and Ruby are protected from the cold. A snow queen, Hylda is based on the eponymous Snow Queen . Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to:"}
