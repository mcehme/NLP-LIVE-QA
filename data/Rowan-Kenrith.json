{"text": "Rowan Kenrith is a former planeswalker from Eldraine , who specializes in electrical magic. She is the twin sister of High King Will Kenrith . He and their friends sometimes affectionately call her Ro . Her other siblings are Erec and Hazel , her father was High King Algenus Kenrith , and her stepmother was Queen Linden . Through her biological mother, she is the niece of the witches Agatha , Eriette , and Hylda . She and her brother lost their shared spark as a result of the Great Pruning . The young warrior-mage twins Rowan and Will Kenrith were unique among planeswalkers in that they shared a single planeswalker's spark . Rowan, bold and impetuous, augmented her swordplay with crackling electrical energy that danced along her blade, while Will, reserved and contemplative, used his power over ice to control the flow of a fight. They often coordinated their magic to make it more effective. Like her twin, Rowan is cursed from birth. Her magic focuses on electricity. According to Liliana Vess in 4561 AR , \"the girl is a force to be reckoned with already. A few more years, and she'll be truly terrifying.\" Her magic is powerful enough to propel her into the air when aimed downward. After New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , she began to learn sleep magic from her aunt Eriette to control the inhabitants of Eldraine through the Wicked Slumber. Rowan Kenrith's center is in red mana. After losing her spark she gained access to black mana. Rowan and her twin were born after a witch had enthralled their father and lived with him for a year. Their birth mother killed the newborns for their blood, which she would've drunk to extend her life. When Algenus regained his conscience he killed the witch. At the same time, their adoptive mother gave up her sword's power to restore life to the twins and took them in as her children. Eldraine Key art. Eighteen years old, the twins' quest for their missing father, the High King, who has been abducted by the planeswalkers Oko and Garruk Wildspeaker . Indrelon the Magic Mirror, reveals the location of their father and that he has been transformed into a stag . Later on, Will rescues Garruk from certain death. His act of braveness and persistence summons the Cauldron of Eternity , which cures the hunter of the Chain Veil curse. The twins fail to protect the stag from the Wild Hunt , but Algenus is brought back to life by his wife Linden. This all happens near a witch's cottage at the fringe of the Wilds, actually, the house where the twins had been born. As Linden reveals the shocking truth about their origins, Rowan becomes upset that they hadn't been told earlier. The shock ignites the twins' planeswalker's spark and they disappear. Garruk, who is thankful for his cure, promises the King and Queen to track their children and keep them safe. Rowan competed with her brother at the stadium of Valor's Reach on Kylem . No one knew where the mysterious pair came from or why they felt the need to test themselves on Valor's Reach. But anyone who faced them in battle realized very quickly their ability to reinforce each other's powers was a force to be reckoned with. The twins were champions of Valor's Reach . The twins go to Strixhaven to hone their magic. The siblings were invited to join Strixhaven as students by Kasmina . While Will fit right in, Rowan had problems adjusting. Moreover, Rowan seemed to lose control over her magic, often crackling with electricity when she lost her temper. The twins' arguments became a full-on quarrel before they were stopped by Professor Onyx . She noticed that they were planeswalkers, and tasked them with coming up with a defense against an Oriq attack. While Will studied the books, Rowan tried to gain more power. Together the Twins defeat Extus and undo the Blood Avatar. After the Oriq and an army of mage hunters began their attack on Strixhaven, Rowan set out to find her brother. After the arrival of the Founder Dragons , Rowan and Will were reunited and saved from an Oriq attack by Professor Onyx. Realizing that the larger assault was only a misdirection, Professor Onyx guided the twins through an old maintenance passage to an area underneath the Biblioplex . There they found Extus Narr who had bound himself to an immense power source called a Snarl. As they attempted to intervene, Professor Onyx was translocated away, leaving only Rowan and Will to face Extus and a summoned war entity, known as the Blood Avatar . Realizing that Rowan had grown in strength during her stay at Strixhaven, but Will had grown in control, they once again joined their powers. With Rowan drawing on the power of the Snarl and redirecting it to Will, her brother managed to wrestle control over the Blood Avatar away from Extus Narr. The Avatar killed the Oriq leader and was sent back from where it came, but not before gravely wounding Will. During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Rowan and Will's parents were killed by the invaders while defending Castle Ardenvale . Rowan is convinced to help with Eriette's plans. In the aftermath of the Invasion, the twins unknowingly lost their shared spark . As the curse of the Wicked Slumber seized the people of Eldraine, tension escalated between the Kenrith twins. Six months after the Invasion, during single combat between Will and Imodane , Rowan cut a massive rift into a nearby mountain, earning it the name Stormcutter Mountain. Desperate to find a cure for the Wicked Slumber, she enlisted the help of a weaver named Royse . Traveling to an abandoned castle, she received a vision of her parents in a dream, urging her to return to Castle Ardenvale . Once there, she was greeted by the planeswalker Ashiok and the witch Eriette , who informed her of her lost spark and familial connection to the witch. Searching for a way to increase her power and protect the citizens of Eldraine, Rowan joined her aunt. When her brother arrived at the castle to end the curse, the two fought. Will was able to defeat Ashiok with the help of Kellan and Ruby , and his knights captured Eriette, though Rowan was able to escape. In the video game Magic: The Gathering Arena , Rowan's voice lines for The Royal Scions are voiced by Anna Graves . In the original plan for the Phyrexian Arc, Rowan was planned to be set up as a future villain. Will would be killed, and his spark disbursed to Rowan's adventuring party. They would then be dragged through the multiverse alongside her to be her allies in whatever her objectives would be.
