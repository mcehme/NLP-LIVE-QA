{"text": "Shadows over Innistrad Booster Battle Packs Card comparisons Deck Builder's Toolkit Intro packs Trivia Shadows over Innistrad is the 70th Magic expansion, and the first in the Shadows over Innistrad block . It was released on April 8, 2016, and is a large expansion . Shadows over Innistrad returns to the gothic horror themed plane of Innistrad , emphasising a sense of mystery and creeping dread. The expansion symbol of the set is an upside down reflection of Avacyn 's symbol. The set features the same tribal components as the Innistrad block with the five main tribes each being split over an allied color pair. Spirits primarily in white and blue, Zombies in blue and black, Vampires in black and red, Werewolves in red and green, and Humans primarily in green and white. For the mechanics, R&D made a conscious decision to return more to Innistrad the set than Innistrad the block. Shadows over Innistrad contains 297 cards (15 basic lands, 105 commons, 100 uncommons, 59 rares, 18 mythic rares), including randomly inserted premium versions of all cards in the set. This is about 25 cards more than other large expansions in recent history. This is because Shadows over Innistrad also sees the return of double-faced cards which have a card frame printed on each side. Two different checklist cards may be used to prevent decks from becoming marked by containing them. These checklist cards replace the basic land in some boosters . Additionally, the design team embraced the idea of having a \"double-faced cards matter\" theme. The as-fan of the double-faced cards is about 1.125, meaning you always get at least one and sometimes get two. A normal pack contains a common or uncommon double-faced card. Approximately one in every eight packs also contains a rare or mythic double-faced card in addition to a normal rare or mythic rare (the rare or mythic rare double-faced card replaces a common). These packs will have two double-faced cards, the common/uncommon and the rare/mythic rare. Checklist card (uncommons and commons) Checklist card (mythics and rares) Innistrad is a world beset by terrible evils on all sides and betrayed by the hope it held most dear. Avacyn has finally returned, but what new evils have come with her? Madness is plaguing the inhabitants. Terror falls from the skies on blood-spattered wings and nameless horrors lurk in the shadows. Odd things are afoot: the forces that had protected the humans have been twisted into something dark and strange. Jace Beleren of the Gatewatch investigates its dark mysteries. Meanwhile, Sorin is in search of the whereabouts of Nahiri . The cards that represent the pivotal moments in the storyline are: Descend Upon the Sinful , Declaration in Stone , Epiphany at the Drownyard , Avacyn's Judgment , Anguished Unmaking In the spoiler season, people noticed that the quotes from Tamiyo 's Journal on the clue tokens differed for each language. This was eventually discovered to point to a code that produced a secret message. To find the message, write down the number of words in the flavor text of each of the six clue tokens.  Then, look at the entry number in the flavor text of Tamiyo's Journal .  Find the clue whose flavor text has a number of words equal to the first digit of the entry number. On that clue, find the word whose position in the flavor text corresponds to the second digit of the entry number.  The third digit indicates where that word is positioned in the secret message. If you repeat this for each other language you get a word from each language and a position in the secret message (English and German have the same word in the same position). After you arrange the words in order, the secret message is: \u201cRemember this they came as three\u201d, referencing Ugin's insight and hinting at the presence of the surviving Eldrazi Emrakul . Shadows over Innistrad is sold in 16-card boosters (one card being a marketing card ), five intro packs , one fat pack , a Deck Builder's Toolkit , Booster Battle Packs and a Gift Box . The boosters feature artwork from Falkenrath Gorger , Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon , Avacyn, the Purifier , Sorin, Grim Nemesis and Jace, Unraveler of Secrets . Due to the Two-Block Paradigm , the Deck Builder's Toolkit is the first of its kind to be released with an expansion instead of a core set . The Gift Box is the first of its kind to be released with a spring set. Part of the marketing campaign for Shadows over Innistrad is the publication of The Hanweir Chronicle , an Innistrad newspaper providing clues for the storyline. On March 5\u20136, Wizards of the Coast hosted \u201cescape rooms\u201d in the form of Markov Manor , Thraben Cathedral and a Stitcher's Lab at various Grand Prix events around the world, while the online audience solved a variety of puzzles to unlock cards from the set.
