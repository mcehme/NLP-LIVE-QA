{"text": "Innistrad Card comparisons Event decks Intro packs Trivia Innistrad is the first set in the Innistrad block . It is the 56th Magic expansion and was released on September 30, 2011. Innistrad is a top-down -designed Magic set, meaning that it was designed and developed with flavor in mind first, \"molding mechanics to fit the concept\". The expansion symbol of the set is a depiction of two outward-facing, overlapping, stylized herons. Innistrad has a gothic horror theme and makes use of horror tropes. It is the first set to thematically take place on the plane of Innistrad . The set features graveyard and tribal mechanics , with the five main tribes each being split over an allied color pair. Spirits primarily in white and blue, Zombies in blue and black, Vampires in black and red, Werewolves in red and green, and Humans primarily in green and white. In each of these pairs, the second color is considered the primary. There are also slight thematic differences between the tribes depending on the color, such as blue zombies being abominations of science in the vein of Frankenstein's Monster , while black Zombies are shambling corpses reanimated by magical spells. Innistrad contains 264 cards (15 basic lands, 107 commons, 67 uncommons, 59 rares, 16 mythic rares), including randomly inserted premium versions of all cards in the set. This is 15 more cards than any large expansion in recent history had. Innistrad also features a number of double-faced cards which have a card frame printed on each side; to handle these when playing without sleeves, three in every four booster packs include a checklist card instead of a basic land. Due to basic lands becoming more rare, Innistrad only contains three basic land artworks rather than the usual four, further enlarging the number of functionally different cards. The double-faced cards were printed on a separate sheet than the other cards in the set, and every booster pack includes a double-faced card. This means that boosters can have two rares and/or mythic rares without either being foil . Innistrad featured the last Magic Invitational card : Snapcaster Mage , created by Tiago Chan . Innistrad is a plane of menace and dread where every creature hides a darker aspect. Here, hedonistic vampires stalk the shadows to quench their thirst, and the full moon can transform a simple villager into a savage werewolf . Main article: Innistrad (plane) Innistrad 6-card booster Innistrad was sold in 16-card boosters , 6-card boosters, five intro packs , two event decks and a fat pack . The 16-card boosters featured artwork from Liliana of the Veil , Garruk Relentless , Terror of Kruin Pass , Olivia Voldaren and Bloodgift Demon . The small booster featured artwork from Grimgrin, Corpse-Born . Innistrad was introduced by way of an alternate reality game , in which bits of story were leaked in the form of various letters, journal entries and other in-world correspondences. The prerelease of the set was September 24\u201325, 2011, the launch party on September 30\u2013October 3, 2011, the Magic Online release was October 17, 2011 and the Game Day was October 29\u201330, 2011. The prerelease promo was the double faced Mayor of Avabruck / Howlpack Alpha ; the launch party promo was Ludevic's Test Subject / Ludevic's Abomination ; and the Game Day promo was a full-art Diregraf Ghoul , with the top 8 receiving a full-art foil Elite Inquisitor . The Buy-a-Box card was Devil's Play . Regular boosters of Innistrad come with a bonus sixteenth card that is either a checklist card, a creature token or rules card with an advertisement on the reverse side. The Innistrad tokens in numerical order are: 4/4 Angel with flying produced by Geist of Saint Traft 1/1 Spirit with flying produced by Doomed Traveler , Geist-Honored Monk , Mausoleum Guard , Midnight Haunting , and Moorland Haunt 2/2 Homunculus produced by Stitcher's Apprentice 5/5 Demon with flying produced by Skirsdag High Priest 2/2 Vampire with flying produced by Bloodline Keeper and Lord of Lineage , its back face 1/1 Wolf with deathtouch produced by Garruk, the Veil-Cursed 2/2 Zombie (3 different images) produced by Undead Alchemist , Army of the Damned , Endless Ranks of the Dead , Moan of the Unhallowed , and Cellar Door */* Ooze with \"This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of slime counters on Gutter Grime.\" produced by Gutter Grime 1/2 Spider with reach produced by Spider Spawning 2/2 Wolf produced by Garruk Relentless , Kessig Cagebreakers , and Howlpack Alpha Day (front)-side Delver of Secrets and its night (back)-side, Insectile Aberration Checklist card Card with the subtype Curse Innistrad is the first set to have cards with different card backs . These cards have two card faces, one on each side, and are used for the transformation mechanic, changing creatures into different creatures and back by turning the card over. When playing with double-faced cards, players may use a checklist which has a regular card back and the player marks on the card which double-faced card the checklist card is supposed to represent. Whenever the card is in a public zone, the checklist card is replaced with the double-faced card. Playing with only the double-faced card is also allowed if the player is playing with opaque sleeves . The transformation mechanic simply consists of the word \" transform \" written on the card in a sentence, similar to sacrifice , counter , or flip . The mechanic also introduces new symbols representing a sun and a moon which appear to the left of a card name similar to the tombstone icon marking graveyard-based mechanics in Odyssey block . The symbols specifically indicate the creature before transformation (day) or after transformation (night). Transforming creatures always enter the battlefield as they are before transformation, and once transformed not all creatures can transform back. During transformations, Auras , Equipment , and Counters stay on the creature. Innistrad also introduces a new subtype for Enchantments named \" Curse \", which are simply Auras which enchant players and have a detrimental effect. The set is partially graveyard-based and features the return of flashback which originated in Odyssey and was reprinted during Time Spiral block . It also introduces the keyword action Fight , which represents the ability of Arena or Tahngarth, Talruum Hero . Two creatures that fight deal damage equal to their power to each other. Innistrad also features the new ability word Morbid in which creatures get benefits if another creature died the turn they entered the battlefield. The set makes use of tribal mechanics, with Vampires, Zombies, Werewolves, Spirits and Humans giving bonuses to each other and have abilities that work against other tribes. A small theme of using +1/+1 counters is also used in the set, particularly with Vampires growing stronger by dealing damage.  References to the number 13 are sprinkled throughout Innistrad cards.  Another minor theme in Innistrad is Equipment used by humans to fight the monsters. Liliana Vess returned as a new card named Liliana of the Veil . Garruk Wildspeaker also returned on a new card, named Garruk Relentless . Garruk Relentless is a double-faced card and the first Planeswalker card with five loyalty abilities. It is also the first Planeswalker card with a continuous triggered ability and the first green-black Planeswalker. No novel creature types were introduced in this expansion. Innistrad has five cycles : Innistrad has two vertical cycles : Main article: Innistrad block#Mega cycle Ancient Grudge , first printed in Time Spiral Blazing Torch , first printed as an uncommon in Zendikar , now a common Curiosity , first printed in Exodus , last seen in Eighth Edition Dissipate , first printed in Mirage Ghost Quarter , first printed in Dissension Mulch , first printed in Stronghold Naturalize , first printed in Onslaught , last seen in Magic 2012 Shimmering Grotto , first printed in Lorwyn Think Twice , first printed in Time Spiral Moon Heron , functional reprint of Snapping Drake ( Portal ) and Talas Air Ship ( Portal Second Age ), save for creature type Riot Devils , functional reprint of Minotaur Warrior ( Portal ), save for creature type Rotting Fensnake , functional reprint of Dross Crocodile ( Fifth Dawn ) and Skeletal Crocodile ( Portal ), save for creature type Thraben Purebloods , functional reprint of Siege Mastodon ( Magic 2010 ), save for creature type Traveler's Amulet , functional reprint of Wanderer's Twig ( Lorwyn ) Voiceless Spirit , functional reprint of Pegasus Charger ( Urza's Saga ), save for creature type Purify the Grave , white colorshifted version of Coffin Purge ( Odyssey ) Stony Silence , white colorshifted version of Null Rod ( Weatherlight ) Main article: Innistrad/Card comparisons See also: Innistrad/Trivia . Delver of Secrets (along with its back face, Insectile Aberration ), sometimes called a \"blue Nacatl\", is arguably the most effective cheap threat in its color (although it was not seen that way either in design or upon its release), widely played in aggro-control tempo decks across all constructed formats. Snapcaster Mage is the Magic Invitational prize card Tiago Chan made and finally collected after four years of development. It would be the last Invitational card released. Snapcaster Mage was a defining card in Standard, and has had a significant impact in Modern and Legacy as well. Geist of Saint Traft is a powerful early-game rush card, given that it's hexproof and can effectively deal 6 damage on turn 4. It is often used alongside Delver of Secrets for tempo. Olivia Voldaren is very reminiscent of Memnarch , being able to turn enemy creatures into vampires then gaining control of them just as Memnarch could turn creatures into artifacts and control them. Olivia, however, can only target creatures, but can power herself up this way in exchange for not being as permanent or flexible as Memnarch. Liliana of the Veil became one of the most powerful planeswalkers ever printed, second only to the infamous Jace, the Mind Sculptor . It is a Modern staple, especially in Jund and Grixis, and in BUG decks in Legacy. Intangible Virtue became part of a very powerful Tokens deck in Standard when combined with Lingering Souls from Dark Ascension . Both cards were later banned in Innistrad block constructed, and are part of the Modern BW Tokens deck, along with Morningtide's Bitterblossom . Diregraf Ghoul follows a long tradition of 2/2 Zombies for which includes Sarcomancy , Carnophage and Accursed Centaur . The first two cards saw widespread tournament play in Suicide Black decks. Laboratory Maniac is an alternate-win card . In general, Innistrad is often considered one of the best sets in Magic history. The combination of a perfect limited experience, extremely powerful and varied cards for standard in all rarities and the large number of cards used for eternal formats has received universal acclaim from magic players. The only sets that come close to the popularity of this set are Ravnica: City of Guilds and Zendikar . Over time, Innistrad has cemented its legacy as one of the best sets ever. In 2019, Mark Rosewater ranked Innistrad first out of 28 sets that he led/co-led design on, saying that he considered it to be his \"tighest\" design . Also in 2019, Luis Scott Vargas and Marshall Sutcliffe both ranked 3x Innistrad as the best Draft format ever in a Limited Resources podcast .
