{"text": "Jaeuhl Carthalion of the Carthalion lineage was a valiant Knight of Kjeldor in the latter part of Dominaria's Ice Age . At a time when his line had lost its prestige, five hundred years after the deeds of his ancestor Jason Carthalion , Jaeuhl lived as an Advocate of the Juniper Order . He was but an inexperienced knight when the planeswalker Freyalise enlisted him to banish Tevesh Szat from Dominaria. Equipped with the Celestial Sword , Nova Pentacle , and Staff of the Ages , Jaeuhl fought off Szat's undead and found the Amulet of Quoz . Using the Amulet, Jaeuhl banished Szat to Shandalar . With Freyalise's aid, he met and soon fell in love with Kaysa , who became pregnant with his child a decade after the casting of the World Spell . He, Jaya Ballard , and the Knights of Kjeldor later  accompanied Kaysa, Laina , Taaveti and other Fyndhorn Elves into Yavimaya . He destroyed a Phyrexian War Beast there with his Celestial Sword. While in Yavimaya, they were also attacked by plants , but eventually allied with the Gorilla Chieftain of Yavimaya and aided in cleansing the Heart of Yavimaya .
