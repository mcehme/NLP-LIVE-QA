{"text": "Virot Maglan , the Cabal Patriarch (also known as The First of the Cabal ) was the leader and founder of Dominaria 's Cabal . As the first and chief worshipper of Kuberr he was gifted with an enormously extended lifespan and the ability to decay anything he touched. Under his influence, the Cabal grew to be highly wealthy and influential on Otaria. He was exiled to Aphetto when Ambassador Laquatus provided Chainer with his secret name, Calchexas , as even with the Mirari Chainer had been unable to kill him. Following Chainer's death, the First regained control over the Cabal based in Aphetto and looked to extend his influence over Otaria by creating the Grand Coliseum . He found a form of love in Phage , who shared his curse of decaying all flesh he touched. He made her increasingly important to the Cabal, placing her in charge of the construction of the Grand Coliseum. However, he soon lost interest and began seeing her as a threat. He attempted to have her killed on several occasions, each of which failed. He eventually had a child with Phage who turned out to be none other than the reborn Kuberr. Shortly after the birth, the First again tried to kill the weakened mother but found that he had lost his immortality due to betraying Kuberr, allowing Braids to intervene and snap him in half with a dementia creature.
