{"text": "Will Kenrith is a former planeswalker who specializes in ice magic, and the current acting king of Eldraine . He is the twin brother of Rowan Kenrith . His other siblings are Erec and Hazel , his father was High King Algenus Kenrith , and his stepmother was Queen Linden . Through his biological mother, he is the nephew of the witches Agatha , Eriette , and Hylda . He and his twin sister lost their shared spark as a result of the Desparkening . Will is a young man with blond hair. He wears rime-coated pauldrons and vambraces and an ice crown in place of a helmet, even in battle. He carries a sword and rides a white warhorse. Will showed interest in both of his childhood friends, Cerise and Titus , implying he is bisexual. He appeared on MTG Pro Shop's Pride 2023 playmat . Like his twin, he was cursed from birth. This curse came to fruition on Arcavios , where he lost his right leg below his knee in the fight against the Blood Avatar . He now uses a lattice-work of ice and steel to replace his leg. All day, a part of his mind has to be focused on shaping and refreezing it around the metal frame. The young warrior-mage twins Rowan and Will Kenrith were unique among planeswalkers in that they shared a single planeswalker's spark . Rowan, bold and impetuous, augmented her swordplay with crackling electrical energy, while Will, reserved and contemplative, used his power over ice to control the flow of a fight. They often coordinated their magic to make it more effective. Will's easy acquiescence during his youth made everyone think he was the obedient twin while Rowan was the headstrong, insubordinate one. This misapprehension gave him space to do what he wanted, which was to seek out secrets he could someday trade to the mirror at Castle Vantress in the hope of winning knighthood there. At Vantress, he aspired to study and learn to his heart's content. After the Phyrexian invasion and the loss of his spark, Will improved his studies in diplomacy and politics in order to become king and unify Eldraine. Will Kenrith is centered in blue mana. After the loss of his spark he gained access to white mana. Will and his twin were born after a witch had enthralled their father and lived with him for a year. Their birth mother killed the newborns for their blood, which she would have drunk to extend her life. When Algenus regained his conscience, he killed the witch. At the same time, their adoptive mother gave up her sword's power to restore life to the twins and took them in as her children. At seventeen, Will experienced a vision in a sheet of ice. He saw a dragon \u2019s skull as tall as a house blocking a forest path with its bony jaws gaped wide open and seen deep down the dark tunnel of its jaws a figure obscured by shadows crouched on a massive branch. As if hearing a cry, the faceless person scrambled down a rope ladder that descended past branches and more branches until it seemed only this vast tree existed in all the world. The vision rippled again to gleam with a host of brightly armored knights as they spread shining wings and rose into the teeth of a mighty wind. But the dazzling beauty of the wings faded, sucked away until nothing was left except a spear so black it absorbed all light, all existence. Indrelon shows where the father of twins is. This vision later came true when the twins visited an amphitheater made of a petrified dragon in the Wilds. They experienced the machinations of the planeswalker Oko, and they witnessed the tribute of the Ardenvale griffin knights after the death of their father. Eighteen years old, the twins quest for their missing father, the High King, who has been abducted by the planeswalkers Oko and Garruk Wildspeaker . Indrelon , the Magic Mirror, reveals the location of their father and that he has been transformed in a stag . Later on, Will rescues Garruk from certain death. His act of braveness and persistence summons the Cauldron of Eternity , which cures the hunter of the Chain Veil curse. The twins fail to protect the stag from the Wild Hunt , but Algenus is brought back to life by his wife Linden. This all happens near a witch's cottage at the fringe of the Wilds, which was the house where the twins had been born. As Linden reveals the shocking truth about their origins, Rowan becomes upset that they hadn't been told earlier. The shock ignites the twins' planeswalker's spark and they disappear. Garruk, who is thankful for his cure, promises the King and Queen to track their children and keep them safe. Will competed with his sister at the stadium of Valor's Reach on Kylem . No one knew where the mysterious pair came from, or why they felt the need to test themselves on Valor's Reach. But anyone who faced them in battle realized very quickly that their ability to reinforce each other's powers was a force to be reckoned with. The twins were champions of Valor's Reach . The twins go to Strixhaven to hone their magic. The siblings were invited to join Strixhaven as students by Kasmina . While Will fitted right in, Rowan had problems adjusting. Moreover, she seemed to lose control over magic, often crackling with electricity when she lost her temper. Their arguments became a full-on quarrel before they were stopped by Professor Onyx . She had noticed that they were planeswalkers and tasked them with coming up with a defense against an Oriq attack. While Will studied the books, Rowan tried to gain more power. Together the Twins defeat Extus and disrupt the Blood Avatar. After the Oriq and an army of mage hunters began their attack on Strixhaven, Will set out to find his sister. He survived a close call with a couple of mage hunters just as the Founder Dragons arrived to help. Will and Rowan were reunited and saved from an Oriq attack by Professor Onyx. Realizing that the larger assault was only a misdirection, Professor Onyx guided the twins through an old maintenance passage to an area underneath the Biblioplex . There they found Extus Narr who had bound himself to an immense power source called a Snarl. As they attempted to intervene, Professor Onyx was translocated away, leaving only Will and Rowan to face Extus and a summoned entity known as the Blood Avatar . Realizing that Rowan had grown in strength during her stay at Strixhaven, but Will had grown in control, they once again joined their powers. With Rowan drawing on the power of the Snarl and redirecting it to Will, her brother managed to wrestle control over the Blood Avatar away from Extus Narr. The Avatar killed the Oriq leader and was sent back from where it came, but not before it hacked off Will's leg. During New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Will and Rowan's parents were killed by the invaders while defending Castle Ardenvale . In the aftermath of the Invasion, the twins unknowingly lost their shared spark . Feeling the Realm needed unity Will took up his father's crown, declaring himself High King of the Realm - though he had not completed a High Quest. In the months following the Invasion, Will took up residence at Castle Vantress and began training every morning as he consolidated power in the Realm. Will was able to convince the raiding knight Imodane to pledge fealty to him. The two assaulted Castle Ardenvale with a phalanx of his knights and were able to defeat the planeswalker Ashiok with the help of the heroes Kellan and Ruby and capture the witch Eriette , ending the Wicked Slumber. Rowan, who had begun learning from Eriette, escaped into the Wilds. In the video game Magic: The Gathering Arena , Will's voice lines for The Royal Scions are voiced by Billy Boyd . In the original plan for the Phyrexian Arc, the story would start in Eldraine and Will Kenrith would have been killed by Sheoldred. Rowan's companions would collectively take on his half of their shared spark so they could travel with her. The fallout from this would lead her to become a villain in Magic' s future stories.
