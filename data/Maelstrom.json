{"text": "The Maelstrom is a chaotic storm of mana that was created in the Conflux , located at the point where the five Shards of Alara met. The Maelstrom was fueled by the war between those five worlds, a war that the elder dragon Nicol Bolas orchestrated. Bolas also used the plane's obelisks, many of which predated the Sundering , to channel mana into the storm. Monstrous entities sprang to life out of the Maelstrom, like the Child of Alara and the Maelstrom Wanderer . Bolas stepped into the center of the storm to regain his godlike powers of old. The elder dragon succeeded in this, but was ultimately stopped from destroying all of Alara by Ajani Goldmane . In response to New Phyrexia's Invasion of Alara , the Maelstrom itself rose against the Phyrexians in defense of the plane.
