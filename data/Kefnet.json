{"text": "Kefnet was the ibis-headed Amonkhet god of knowledge. With his ibis head and glorious wings, he represented intellect and the magic of the mind. Kefnet oversaw the Trial of Knowledge (the second trial) and judged worthiness based on mental prowess. He believed that knowledge is power and his greatest weapon was his mental acumen and magical ability. Kefnet was also the god who was responsible for the maintenance of the Hekma, drawing power from the Luxa to maintain its water. During the Hour of Promise, Kefnet was killed by the Scorpion God , alongside Oketra , while trying to protect the mortals of Naktamun and repair the Hekma . Kefnet was zombified . During the War of the Spark on Ravnica , he reappeared as a God-Eternal in Bolas's army. Ral Zarek sheared off his right arm with a massive lightning bolt, but the Ibis God didn't seem to notice. In the end, Kefnet was incinerated by the resurrected Niv-Mizzet . Kefnet appears to be based on Thoth , the Egyptian god of Knowledge and Magic, who is also often depicted with the head of an Ibis .
