{"text": "Almaaz was a powerful kingdom and the only surviving \u2018nation\u2019 on the continent of Terisiare on Dominaria that dated from before the Brothers' War . After the Ice Age , it became one of the five main Terisian Isles . It is located east of Lat-Nam , south of Gulmany and west of Yavimaya and New Argive . It is bordered by the South Sea , the Sea of Almaaz in the north and the Sea of Laments in the east. Almaaz before the War was both a nation and a culture that spread over the southwestern portion of Terisiare. Some say it was a place of rich culture and fine craftsmanship. Almaazan songmages that lived in the capital city Sumifa offered their powers to the Fallaji Empire in the war to avoid the destruction of their nation. Ashnod was sent to Almaaz by Mishra to oversee iron and lumber harvesting afterward, although civil war eventually broke out. After the Brothers' War, then the Time of the Erg Raiders came, Almaazan cities were attacked by dune raiders or thirst-crazed military tribes. During Ice Age , most of Almaaz was ruled by the Glacial Kingdom of ancient ice beings called the Rigida . After the Ice Age, Almaaz was refounded. By that time, Terisiare was broken up into several islands. The culture of the New Sumifans annexed the then-abandoned city and became its primary occupants. It is possible that the later Phyrexian Invasion and the events thereafter may have once more brought ruin to the area. The song-mage Thabit of Almaaz played an important role in the rebellion of Epityr against Sheoltun . Fallajia , the Fallaji nation of the eastern deserts and plains. A tiny remnant of the ancient mighty Fallaji Empire . Glavia : a town from which shirrir, an illegal narcotic spice, was smuggled in Sumifa. Truf : a town known for its ganzite, a glittering mineral.
