{"text": "Emeria or Em is the Merfolk goddess of the realms of the sky, wind, and clouds on Zendikar . The name Emeria is also used for the Skyclave above Tazeem , where it was believed the goddess once dwelt. Emeria is known as Kamsa by the Kor and is their goddess of the wind, the breath of the world. Both deities are female and come from the same source: long-lost memories of the terrible Eldrazi Emrakul . Emeria was conceptualized as a great angelic being\u2014an impartial refuge in a dangerous world, her halo a sign of hope. Her followers believe she brings an ethereal wisdom and airy mysticism to her devotees. Merfolk believed that the floating hedrons and buildings that comprise Emeria, the Sky Ruin were once the home of the Goddess. Supplicants used to offer hedron shards and land fruit to her. During Emrakul's psychic attack on Jace Beleren , his mind conceptualized the Eldrazi's consciousness as Emeria. Emeria also appeared in a vision to Nissa while the latter was taking the Trial of Knowledge on Amonkhet . It is unknown if this vision originated from Emrakul. The shape of Emeria's wings and ribbon-like dress in the art of Shrine of the Forsaken Gods is reminiscent of Emrakul's mantle and tentacles, especially in Emrakul, the Promised End .
