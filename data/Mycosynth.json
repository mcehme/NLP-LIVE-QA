{"text": "Mycosynth was a strange metallic, fungal organism created due to the corruption of Mirrodin with Phyrexian oil . Mycosynth was released in spores throughout the plane, changing metal into flesh and vice versa, which consequently caused metallic growths in the skin of organic beings while simultaneously converting artifact creatures into living organisms. The vedalken theorized that mycosynth spores caused metal to begin growing in the womb. Large towers of the substance built up in Mirrodin's Core in elaborate lattices while golems composed of the substance also came into being (whether spontaneously or by Memnarch 's will is unknown). The Mycosynth was initially controlled by Memnarch , but upon his death it spread out of control, infecting Mirran organisms and turning them into Phyrexians . When New Phyrexia took over, the former core of Mirrodin became the Mycosynth Gardens , where the fungi are allowed to grow without restriction. Though the Mycosynth spawned New Phyrexia, it ironically prevents Phyrexians from becoming entirely metallic due to constantly turning metal into flesh. It is described as having an oily, fungal scent. Depicted in: Referred to:"}
