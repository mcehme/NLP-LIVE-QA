Main article: God Theros' pantheon is perhaps some of Magic's best defined deities, being unambiguously real. Like some angels and demons , Theros' gods are living enchantments, making the concept of enchantments considered divine blessings by the plane's mortals. They are associated with the paranormal realm known as Nyx , the night sky, which is in turn associated with dreams and the subconscious; there is something of an implication that these gods are powered/come to into being by belief, though this is not explicit. The Theros pantheon is seemingly very large, but there are five main gods aligned with the colors of mana, at least eleven minor gods and some gods that have been forgotten (like the one who represented love ). During Phyrexian Invasion of Theros , the power of belief was exploited by the phyrexians . The followers of the gods were compleated , in turn warping their beliefs and making some of the gods phyrexians themselves. The extent to which the pantheon was phyrexianized is not known, although Heliod was compleated for certain, as is the purity of Ephara. Heliod ( ), God of the Sun.
