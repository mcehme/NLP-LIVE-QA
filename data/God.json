{"text": "Although gods and deities have been part of Magic for a long time, a special God creature type had to be introduced for the Greek-inspired Theros block as the Greek pantheon was the very center of their mythology. The gods were complemented by monsters and heroes . The word \"god\" is used gender neutrally, meaning it can signify a male or female. Almost all Gods have a mechanic that either makes them difficult to destroy or allows them to recur (except the Gods from Kaldheim ). Some are very cheaply costed for their power level but have mechanics that restrict their use as a creature unless a certain condition is met. Gods debuted in Theros and returned in Theros Beyond Death . The gods of Theros are indestructible legendary enchantment creatures (living enchantments). For this reason, all enchantments on this plane are thought to be gifts from the gods, a unique form of magic enabled by divinities. The gods grant their favors to those whose devotion is great enough. Gamewise, they don't manifest as creatures on the battlefield until a player's devotion to their color is high enough. If a God enters the battlefield while the player's devotion to its color is less than the required number, abilities that trigger when a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger. If a God on the battlefield is a creature and the player's devotion to its color drops below the required number, it immediately stops being a creature. A God can't attack the turn it enters the battlefield unless it has haste, even if it wasn't a creature as it entered the battlefield. They are all legendary enchantments and their abilities work whether they're creatures or not. Gods returned in Amonkhet block . They are animal-headed and are not enchantment creatures. They each have two keyword abilities, one of which is indestructible. They have a condition they need to meet to be able to attack and block and then they have an activated ability that helps them reach that condition. With Hour of Devastation , three corrupted gods were introduced. These forsake previous conventions of indestructible and conditional attacking or blocking for returning to the hand mechanics and lack of special conditions, having instead more direct activated abilities. They also have higher mana costs. Ilharg , a primordial deity of Ravnica , is represented by its own card. It can be returned to its owner's library upon death or exile. The monocolored gods from Amonkhet , except Hazoret, return as zombie deities. They share the same return mechanics as Ilharg, who replaces Hazoret as the red god in the cycle. Gods in Kaldheim are neither indestructible nor do they have return mechanics, in line with the fact the Gods of the Norse pantheon can be killed. Instead, they are modal double-faced cards with permanents , such as equipment , other creatures , and planeswalkers . New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse brought together many planes into one set, including new iterations of Hazoret, Heliod, Ephara, and Esika. None of these use the usual combat restriction, though Ephara being on the back of Invasion of Theros does follow the concept so in a different way. The Gods of Ixalan are shapeshifters based on Mesoamerican deities. In contrast to the often-distant gods of Theros, the gods of Amonkhet take an active hand in the life of their worshippers and are physically present within the city of Naktamun. They oversee various trials that bring chosen warriors closer to the afterlife and prepare their servants for the tasks that will await them. It is recorded in the Accounting of Hours that when the God-Pharaoh returns, the gods will have to prove their worth to him just like the mortals they tested before. Nissa later discovered that the gods were manifestations of the plane's leylines and whatever Bolas had done to the plane had also altered them in such subtle ways that they were oblivious to it. Their presence alone fills mortals with feelings associated with their domain and they can see directly into the heart of any mortal presented before them. Most of the gods died when Bolas returned and ushered in the Hour of Devastation, leaving only Hazoret to guide the survivors of Naktamun. Their legacy lived on , notably with Basri Ket and Oketra. Oketra , God of Solidarity ( ) Kefnet , God of Knowledge ( ) Bontu , God of Ambition ( ) Hazoret , God of Zeal ( ) Rhonas , God of Strength ( ) Three other gods were imprisoned and warped by Bolas to serve his interests during the Hour of Revelation. The original functions and appearances and even the names of these gods have been lost. The Locust God ( ), who would destroy the Hekma . The Scarab God ( ), who would lead the Eternals . The Scorpion God ( ), who would kill the other gods. Killed during the Hour of Devastation While not technically a god, Nicol Bolas was worshiped as the God-Pharaoh of Amonkhet and pretended to be the creator of the gods and the plane. Even when his charade was discovered, some kept faith , and the Eternals continue to worship him at the exclusion of the deities they worshipped in life . Svyelun of Sea and Sky ( ), the Merfolk god, is the only Dominarian deity recognized in the cards as a god. Others such as Gaea , Yawgmoth , and Serra are revered as deities, but none are literal or mechanical gods. The current ruling family of gods, the Skoti , supplanted the ancient Einir a few centuries ago. The seven surviving Einir Leaders are currently imprisoned in Jaspera Trees , and the power of their descendants the Wood elves and Shadow elves is greatly diminished. While there have been multiple \"families\" of gods, they have all had a cosmic connection to the essence of the World Tree . The elves believe that the Einir used to channel it through their connection with Koma , while the Skoti imbibe a magical \"Cosmos Elixir\" created by Esika, the god of the World Tree. The Cosmos Elixir also slows their aging and maintains their divine powers. The Skoti are incredibly powerful, but they are also selfish, prone to bickering, and constantly causing trouble in the realms. In addition to being exceptionally strong, fast, or nimble, each god has special powers and abilities connected to its sphere of influence. The gods have strong personalities, and each is involved in a tangled web of relationships with their kin. While each god is individually powerful, their internal conflicts are becoming increasingly problematic for the plane. Because of the Cosmos Elixir that makes the gods what they are, the gods are immune to the disorienting effects of the Cosmos and can cross between the realms more easily than other races. It's still a challenging journey to simply walk between planes, so they often use magical objects that open an Omenpath or, in rare cases, transport them directly between realms. The Cosmos Elixir still slows down the aging of the gods. The Skoti, unlike other gods of other planes , are born infants, grow and age, and can have child gods among themselves. The Einir sealed the demons into Immersturm using powerful magical objects of their design. When the Skoti challenged the Einir's supremacy and defeated them, these relics were lost. The Skoti used runic magic to reseal Immersturm, but they have been less than vigilant about maintaining the safeguards. The Skoti: Alrund , God of Wisdom and the Cosmos ( ) Birgi , God of Boasting and Tales ( ) Cosima , God of the Sea and Voyage ( ) Egon , God of Death ( ) Esika , God of the World Tree ( ) Halvar , God of Battle ( ) Jorn , God of Weather and Winter ( ) Kolvori , God of Kinship ( ) Reidane , God of Justice ( ) Tergrid , God of Fear and Fright ( ) Toralf , God of Thunder and Fury ( ) Valki , God of Lies ( ) The Einir: Lathril ( ) The Sun Empire worships the Threefold Sun , a deity manifested by the different stages of the sun. It is in direct opposition to Aclazotz , the bat god of night, leader of demons and instigator of the curse of vampirism . There is a more varied and complex pantheon of deities in Ixalan's Core , based around the underground sun Chimil . Threefold Sun : Kinjalli Ixalli Tilonalli Aclazotz Ojer Axonil ( ) Ojer Kaslem Chimil Ilharg , the Raze-Boar ( ) is a boar god worshipped by some among the Gruul Clans of Ravnica , who believe he will bring the End-Raze and destroy civilization. Theros has a unique metaphysical property: things believed and dreamed here eventually become true. The collective unconscious of millions of people has the literal power of creation, though the process unfolds over countless centuries. Thus the gods of Theros and their servants were believed, dreamed of, and narrated into existence, materializing and becoming fully real as a result of mortal belief in their power. On Theros, the gods oversee the most important aspects of Theran life. The five major gods of the pantheon are monocolored . Ten two-colored enchantment creatures serve as the minor gods. The colors give each god a unique identity. The five major gods are featured in Theros , while the ten minor gods are featured in Born of the Gods and Journey into Nyx . The gods strive with each other over the devotion of the mortals. When people fervently pray to a god, observe their rites and sacrifices, and trust in their divine might, a god becomes more powerful. Mortal beings often become unwilling pawns in the contest of the gods. Having a powerful champion is an indication of a god's might. A champion acts as an agent of a god among mortals, and helps increase those people's devotion to that god.

Mark Rosewater has stated that the Myojin -cycle can be seen as the precursor to the Theros Gods. If they had been designed under the current design vision, the cards would have been creature-type God, likely Spirit God or God Spirit. The Patron Kami were also referred to as \"gods\" during the development of Betrayers of Kamigawa . The concept of \"kami\" of Shinto does not particularly distinguish between spirits or gods, and cultural Japanese religions (Buddhism being the other major one) do not consider pantheons as the Western religions do. However, it is often used as the closest analog of \"god\" in translation, even though cultural understanding is often lacking. The gods of Theros are based, to a lesser or greater degree, on divinities of the Greek pantheon. Similarly, the Skoti are based on Norse gods and the Amonkhet pantheon is based on the Egyptian gods. The gods of Amonkhet have golden parts on their bodies about the fact that the ancient Egyptians believed that the flesh of their gods was made of gold. The creature type \"God\" is used for both male and female gods, both because a word longer than \"God\" wouldn't have fit on the card's type line after \" Legendary Enchantment Creature \" and because R&D didn't want to have to refer to \"God or Goddess\" on cards that interacted with them. However, the creature type \"Demigod\" later appeared in Theros Beyond Death ; they solved the issue of the words not fitting on the type line by making the text smaller. The crossover C'tan race are considered gods of the Necron ."}
