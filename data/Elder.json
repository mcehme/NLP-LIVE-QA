{"text": "Elder is a creature type , first used for the Elder Dragons and later used on huge primordial entities and venerable creatures to denote their importance. Since it never stands without a race it is effectively a creature class . Originally, the creature type was only used on the Elder Dragons of Legends , and like most old creature types, it was meant to be read as a unified creature type (much like Ali-from-Cairo or Lord of Atlantis ) and described a specific race: they were not \"Elder\" and \"Dragon\", they were \" Elder Dragons \". The creature type was then unsupported for a long time, meaning that while it wasn't removed from the existing cards, it wasn't added to new ones. The subtype was retained because of how iconic the cycle of dragons from Legends was. Starting with Dragons of Tarkir , the type Elder was finally brought back, this time used to describe the venerable age of a cycle of Dragon Lords whose importance creative wanted to emphasize. Interestingly, they decided to un-retire the type Elder instead of the type Lord because the connection with the original Elder Dragons was meant as a homage; but it, unfortunately, created some confusion as to whether or not these new dragons were members of the same race as the old ones. Following the un-retirement of the subtype, it started being used more regularly with Rivals of Ixalan featuring six Elder Dinosaurs , the first Elders that weren't Dragons, followed by an Elder Demon in Dominaria , as well as two Elder Giants in Theros Beyond Death . Elder returned in Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate . This time, it was used on a cycle of non-legendary metallic dragons. The vast power of the ancient Elder Dragons of Dominaria was said to rival that of planeswalkers . At least two of them, Nicol Bolas and Ugin, became planeswalkers themselves. They participated in the Elder Dragon War , a conflict that shook the plane of Dominaria and killed most of their kind. Early storyline sources referred to them with the title of Dominia , but with the release of the story for Core 2019 , it seems that the Elder Dragon War took place only on the plane of Dominaria.

While not members of the Elder Dragon race, the creature type was used to represent their great age and the respect they command (tying in with the theme of time travel of the block) and to pay direct homage to Legends ' s cycle of dragons. It was later revealed that they are the direct descendants of Ugin . Dromoka ( ) Ojutai ( ) Silumgar ( ) Kolaghan ( ) Atarka ( ) At the birth of the plane , as the mana of two planes overlapped in conflicting ways, many forms of life adapted to the new structure, and many new forms of life were spawned. Five particularly powerful vortices of overlapping mana became luminous spheres, from which were hatched five dragons . These dragons have become emblems of the magic of the plane, living symbols of the clashing forces of the five dichotomies. The Founder Dragons were the first to master the magic of the five opposing combinations. When the humanoid races arose, the dragons were at first angered that mortals would try to harness the wild forces of magic, but they came to realize that only through disciplined study would magic be in safe hands. So, centuries ago, the dragons founded an institution devoted to the study of the five mana dichotomies, and that institution is now known as Strixhaven . The five colleges were based around the magic mastered by each of those dragons. To this day, the Founder Dragons roam the world, the five deadly sages of the skies. They no longer associate directly with Strixhaven, preferring to let the deans of the colleges, or their human mouthpiece Director Taiva, speak in their stead. The dragons' wisdom is vast, but their tempers can be short. Mages seek them out only to learn the most elusive of secrets. Five Elder Dragons founded Strixhaven , the most elite school of mages in the multiverse. Each college takes its name directly from the elder dragon that created them.

Ugin was revealed to be spawned from The Ur-Dragon alongside his twin, Nicol Bolas , in a later Magic story, confirming he was born an Elder Dragon. Although many cards have \"elder\" in their name (for example Argothian Elder , Elder Land Wurm , Leaf-Crowned Elder , Elder Brain or Revered Elder ), none of them have the subtype Elder. Although Niv-Mizzet is over 16,000 years old, he is not considered an Elder Dragon. However, Mark Rosewater has indicated that \u201cit\u2019s possible he should be an Elder.\u201d Dragons Elder Land Wurms"}
