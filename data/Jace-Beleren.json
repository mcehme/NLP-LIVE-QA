{"text": "Jace Beleren ( Phyrexian : auL , IPA : [\u02a4es] ) is a compleated human planeswalker and mind-mage from Vryn . While working with the Infinite Consortium on Ravnica , he went by the name Berrim . He is the former Living Guildpact of Ravnica and a founding member of the Gatewatch . He was compleated during the events of Phyrexia: All Will Be One . Jace is incredibly intelligent and capable of such talents as clairvoyance and illusion . His specialty, though, is in the art of mental magic which makes him unique within the multiverse . He has a reserved nature and a troubled conscience for the poor decisions he has made in the past. Curious, and always in control, Jace is a master of mind-reading, and memory modification, and is a master illusionist. His telepathic powers allow him to manipulate enemy mages by countering their magic or using their spells against them. He is mostly self-taught, as he has a habit of losing or deleting his memories. An adept analyst, he has an optimized plan, and a backup plan, for every situation. Jace is a slender young man with unkempt chestnut brown hair. He is 5'10\" tall and weighs 160lbs. His white facial tattoos were created by the Ravnican Gruul , who took him in as a child. On his cloak, he sports a symbol derived from it: an elongated ring, open at the bottom, with a circle floating in the middle. The symbol represents a sphinx's collar, which for a long time was the one remaining memory of his home plane . He apparently used illusions for a time to make himself look more fit, but stopped doing so after he got in shape on Ixalan . He has a scar on his right ring finger, and another that begins on his knuckle and runs stick-straight up his arm. He has a small brown freckle in his eye. Jace is centered in blue mana. When creating spells, Jace's eyes shine bright blue with magic. He usually tries to avoid physical combat. As he planeswalks, he disappears in a complex crisscross pattern of blue light. Jace plays chess, and considers himself good at it. Jace also says memoirs are his favorite book genre because he likes interesting people. Jace confronts his master Alhammarret Jace was born at Silmot's Crossing on the plane of Vryn . His unique gift of telepathy manifested very early in his life, often to his parent's immense embarrassment. Desperate to curb the young man's precocious nature, his father sought the assistance of the local mage known as Alhammarret . Alhammarret took Jace from his father, Gav Beleren , and allowed him to become his apprentice at age thirteen. Under his tutelage, Jace spent years learning new spells and talents, but most importantly, he began to feel welcome for the first time in memory. It was not to last though. Jace eventually became strong enough to try his talents against his master and learned the shocking truth of his existence. He discovered that his spark had ignited over a year ago, dipping him into the Blind Eternities only for a moment. Alhammarret had lied to him about what had happened, telling him his illusions had backfired and not to concern himself with it. Alhammeret confided in Jace's father about the event, and they agreed to keep the truth from Jace. Jace seethed over this news for days, holding his temper close to his heart until finally, during one of their practice sessions, Jace snapped. He slipped into Alhammarret's mind and unleashed all of his rage and pain at once, destroying his master's mind. Jace fled, a wanted individual everywhere within a hundred miles of his hometown. Finally, Jace erased his memories, so that he would never have to see his teacher's face again and feel the weight of what he had done. With his mind shattered from the confrontation with Alhammarret, Jace's spark ignites In a more recent update to Jace's origin, Alhammarret was revealed to be a sphinx who arbitrated between the two warring factions of Vryn. After two years of training, Alhammarret began sending Jace out to gather information. Under the cover of darkness and cloaked by illusions , Jace would sneak into a camp of one of the opposing sides to learn about the army's battle plans. During one of these reconaissance missions, Jace tried to enter his master's mind, a feat he had never accomplished before. He learned the shocking truth of his existence: his spark had ignited a year ago, dipping him into the Blind Eternities only for a moment. Alhammarret had lied to him about what had happened and had repeatedly wiped the incident from the young man's mind. When Jace finally found out, he began to erase his knowledge to keep it away from the sphinx. Instead, he kept records on paper. Later it turned out that Alhammarret was playing both warring factions against each other by providing them with military intel, and thus keeping his status as arbiter intact. He used Jace as a go-between, to gather information from the Ampryn and the Trovians, deliver it, and learn more just in the delivery. And every time, he'd wiped Jace's memory of it, taken the money for himself, and kept the war going. Eventually, Jace goaded his master into a duel of telepathy. At the cost of much of his mind (and, inadvertently, his memories), he destroyed the Sphinx's mind, rendering Alhammarret unable to breathe. The force of the battle, in combination with the damage done to himself, forced Jace to accidentally planeswalk away, landing himself in the streets of Ravnica . Jace found his way to the plane of Ravnica after some time. Here he settled into a comfortable life, living in the upper echelons of society and earning his money through blackmail. He would use his telepathy to learn the secrets of the wealthy and extort money from them for his continued silence. While conducting business, Jace was attacked by creatures summoned by members of the Infinite Consortium . After some brief background research, Jace confronted the Consortium's master Tezzeret and learned that these attacks were, in fact, an \"invitation\" for Jace to join Tezzeret 's organization. With some hesitation, Jace agreed and began training with Tezzeret to hone his telepathy for the Consortium's use. Jace was partnered with a blademaster by the name of Kallist Rhoka , who by some coincidence looked remarkably like Jace, and together they began to train each other in their specialties between assignments. After a few years, Jace came to realize how badly the Consortium's practices had impacted him and began to feel guilty, ironically, of not feeling any guilt over some of the things he has done in the Consortium's name. Things started to come to a head when a mission to Kamigawa ended spectacularly with the massacre of a Nezumi village. As punishment, Tezzeret savagely beats Jace for failing, though the mission failed through no fault of Jace's. Shortly thereafter, an agent of Nicol Bolas , the original master of the Infinite Consortium and Tezzeret's main rival, contacted Tezzeret over a mining dispute on an unknown plane. Tezzeret scheduled a meeting with the dragon on an arctic plane and brought Jace along to ensure that Bolas did not attempt to probe Tezzeret's mind. Jace became distracted by the dragon, who held two conversations with them both. Jace's defenses, which were untested, to begin with, failed when Bolas struck. After fleeing for their lives from Bolas's forces, Jace succumbed to frostbite and lost a toe. This was the least of his injuries though, as Tezzeret used his manablade to torture Jace for having failed despite his inexperience and the vast difference between his power and that which Bolas possessed. Jace vs Tezzeret Finally, Jace grew uneasy with Tezzeret's methods and total lust for power, and after refusing a task that went against his very nature, he ultimately fell out of Tezzeret's graces. Jace took Kallist with him and ran to the farthest reaches of Ravnica in hopes of escaping the Consortium's wrath. While trying to lie low, the pair ran into the lovely necromancer Liliana Vess , who flirted endlessly with both of them, finally settling into a torrid affair with Jace. Without Jace's knowledge, and with a heavy heart, Liliana revealed where Jace and Kallist had settled to the Consortium. In a desperate attempt to save both their lives, Jace tried to absorb Kallist's mind and switched bodies with the assassin when it failed. Six months later, \"Jace\" in Kallist's body died and his mind returned to its original body with extreme trauma to Jace's psyche. Liliana took him away to recover and urged him to pursue Tezzeret for his part in Kallist's death. This resulted in Tezzeret and Jace scheming against each other, Tezzeret trying to kill Jace for his insubordination and impudence, and Jace just wanting to finally be free from Tezzeret and the Consortium. Jace turned to Nicol Bolas for help in locating Tezzeret's sanctum, and he and Liliana planned an assault on the artificer's base. Ultimately, the attack failed, Jace was captured, and Liliana's treachery came to light. Tezzeret spent months constructing an artifact to control Jace's mind without damaging his abilities, all the while having Jace tortured violently by the pyromancer Baltrice . Liliana approached the captured Jace and tried to make him understand the reasons she'd done the things she had. She genuinely cared for him, and she helped Jace to escape the prison Tezzeret constructed. Together they again attempted to destroy Tezzeret, wreaking havoc in his base of operations. Ultimately, Jace and the artificer dueled, resulting in Jace wiping Tezzeret's mind clean, leaving the consortium without a leader. Jace made a vow to himself to help Liliana in any way that he could. At some point during Jace's first year working for the Infinite Consortium, he was sent to track down and retrieve a scroll Chandra had stolen from the Sanctum of Stars in Kephalai . However, his mission was to erase all memories of it from the pyromancer's mind, and not just to return the scroll to Kephalai. He tracked her to the monastery of Keral Keep where he confronted the girl. After a short battle, Jace completed his objective and planeswalked away. Jace is attacked by an Eldrazi Roughly three years after retrieving the Dragon Scroll from Chandra, Jace's interest in it was once more piqued for an unknown reason. With Garruk's \"assistance\", Jace soon decoded the location in the scroll as Zendikar . Shortly thereafter, he followed in Chandra's footsteps, having hired a guide to climb through the mountains of Akoum . Using his skill at illusion to keep himself safe, he and his guide soon encountered the bedraggled Anowon , who attacked Jace and killed his treacherous guide. Subduing Anowon, Jace ripped the information he sought from the vampire's mind and convinced him to replace his guide to the Eye of Ugin . Upon arriving at the Eye, a wall closed between the two, with Anowon shouting warnings at Jace that fell on deaf ears. What Jace found, much to his surprise, was an immense Dragon fighting Chandra, who was hard-pressed to continue the fight. Jace immediately offered his help but was stunned to find his spells malfunctioning and one of the Hedrons floating about the cave absorbing his magic. Acting upon intuition and things he had gleaned from the scroll that led him here, Jace told Chandra to try and generate fire that could not be seen. With it, the pair defeated Sarkhan, knocking the entire group unconscious. Chandra was the first to awake and pulled Jace to his feet before walking away, leaving Jace to ponder who had manipulated the pair into crossing paths. With Chandra gone, Jace had no reason to stay in the Eye. With his goal accomplished, albeit catastrophically, he wandered the caves and questioned once more how all three walkers came to be in the same place at the appropriate time. Despite his ignorance of the plane and the Eye, Jace couldn't help but notice that something had been set in motion with his involvement. He resolved to inform the sages of Sea Gate at Halimar of this development, but before he could leave the labyrinth, Anowon returned, demanding to know what had happened. Before Jace had a chance to answer, the vampire sage stalked off into the heart of the Eye muttering to himself. With no guide, Jace managed to find a nearby town and acquired a mount to ride. Wasting no time, he began his trek back to the ship to finish his voyage. On the way, an enormous member of the Eldrazi Brood attacked, killing Jace's mount but leaving the mind mage unscathed. Jace arrived at the boat and continued on his way. Two weeks later, Jace stood consulting an archivist at the Lighthouse of Halimar. He learned a bit about the Eldrazi but felt no wiser for the knowledge. He recounted the events of his journey for her and decided to search out where Chandra learned of the scroll. The merfolk archivist begged Jace to return if he learned anything, and Jace walked away saying he would share anything he found. Jace's Sanctum. After the tumult of the past few years of his life, Jace ignored whatever obligations remained on Ravnica, choosing to just wander for a while. When he returned, the consortium had collapsed without him, but he couldn't seem to bring himself to care. Indeed, despite feeling at home in Ravnica's faceless masses, Jace was haunted by the things he had seen. It was no wonder, then, that when curious symbols and patterns started turning up all over the Tenth District, it was enough to make Jace pause and take note. It was just the distraction he needed. Jace contacted a peer named Kavin, a vedalken , with whom he worked to unwind the puzzle of the mysterious marks and why the Izzet League was interested in them. Unlike his accomplice though, Jace's interest turned to near obsession. He worked feverishly, and fruitlessly, until Emmara took note of his absence and came to check on him. After several pleasantries, she gave Jace a small wooden pendant and offered Jace a place in the Conclave. He refused, but she still asked for his assistance. Jace was not the only one to have noticed the Izzet's flurry of activity. Unfortunately, the pair had also attracted the attention of House Dimir . Several days after, Jace secretly tracked Ral Zarek and his associates back to the Izzet Guildgate . He was shocked to find Niv-Mizzet himself waiting for Zarek and with his chance slipping through his fingers, he seized the opportunity, making a mental connection with the firemind itself. Jace attained the answers he sought, but at the cost of attracting the attention of the dragon. Kavin was not as thrilled with Jace's answers as the young telepath had been. The archivist was insistent they walk away, and reluctantly, Jace agreed, even going so far as to erase the memories of six months worth of work. Unfortunately, while Jace worked at that, the Cult of Rakdos abducted Emmara. Jace immediately went after them as soon as he awoke, distraught at both the abduction and the sudden gap in his memories. The forces of the Azorius Senate had other plans for him though. Eluding Lavinia and the arresters with the help of Ruric Thar , Jace desperately tried to piece together what had happened and how he could help Emmara. The only clue he had was a small token pointing him to a Rakdos nightclub. After a less than pleasant discourse at the club with the blood witch Exava , Jace escaped the cult and made his way to the Golgari controlled neighborhoods of District Ten, having snatched the location out of the mind of the Rakdos. Following the power of a leyline , Jace encountered Varolz , only to have Emmara save him. While distracted, Mirko Vosk struck. Jace research on the Implicit Maze of Azor The vampire gravely wounded Emmara and tried to psychically assault Jace, finding the mage knew nothing of what he had been looking for. The vampire retreated, frustrated that Jace had been one step ahead. After tending their wounds, the pair headed back to Vitu-Ghazi . When they arrived, Emmara was received warmly and Jace with suspicion. Jace was introduced to Emmara's paramour, Captain Calomir . This discovery shook Jace worse than almost everything that had happened to him up until that point. Emmara's abduction had sparked hostility within the conclave, spearheaded by Calomir. Jace, feeling put upon, tried to read the man, only to discover he couldn't. He quickly deduced Calomir wasn't who he said he was, but Jace's suspicions were ill-received, and he was quickly thrown from Conclave territory. Left drifting listlessly, Jace couldn't shake the feeling that Emmara was in danger, as his friend was the only thing important to him on the entirety of Ravnica. So, with few other options, Jace turned to Lavinia, the Azorius lawmage who had been sent to arrest him in the first place. He shared what he knew of the plots the Dimir were weaving, and in exchange, he tried to trade that knowledge for whatever the Azorius knew of what he had forgotten. Unfortunately, Lavinia was not in such a giving mood, and his only lead became the Gruul ogre he had hired to destroy his sanctum. Jace managed to track Ruric Thar down and while trying to discover whatever secret he had uncovered, unintentionally challenged the ogre to combat. Unable to use his magic against the pair, Jace found unexpected empathy from the Gruul warriors watching the bout. Jace tapped into those thoughts and used them to beat the ogre. Having proven himself, Ruric Thar agreed to let Jace search his mind, and the planeswalker found bits of what he was looking for, enough to go on, but at that moment, Exava, leading a riot of her cultists finally tracked him down. The Gruul put themselves in between the cultists and Jace, but he was reluctant to leave them to their fates. He summoned a gigantic illusion of Rakdos himself and commanded the riot back into their territory. Exava was livid, but could not overcome the awe Jace's effigy inspired. However, once they returned, they found the Conclave forces waiting. It was enough to break Jace's concentration and Exava once again managed to corner him. The riot came to an abrupt end as Niv Mizzet made a district-wide announcement, revealing very nearly every secret behind the Implicit Maze Jace had worked so hard to learn again. With the announcement made, Exava prepared to torture Jace, but he was saved at the last moment... by Lazav . The shapeshifter ferried him away into the undercity, explaining many of his plans to the telepath before turning him over to the tender ministrations of Mirko Vosk once more. With little choice, he planeswalked away from the Dimir prison, but not before Vosk managed to get the maze route from Jace's mind as he desperately shared it with Emmara. Awakening on Zendikar, Jace considered just leaving it all behind and abandoning Ravnica altogether. An encounter with a kor family changed his mind though, and determined to help Emmara, he returned. His first destination was the Forum of Azor, the endpoint of the maze. There, he discovered the Bailiff, a magical being made of law that was bound to the Maze. The construct told him that he was the executor of Azor's judgment and that if the guilds completed the trial, a new Guildpact would be actualized by the most worthy. If they didn't, he would deliver the Supreme Verdict of Azor. With new questions about the maze, he tracked Lavinia to a meeting where Isperia and a disguised Lazav were discussing the Verdict. Isperia told the pair that it was a spell that could destroy all the guilty in a district and they realized that the Supreme Verdict would be the verdict to the trial of the maze. More determined than ever, Jace made his way to the Transguild Promenade for the starting ceremony. There, he reconnected with Emmara and told her what he had discovered. As soon as the maze began, chaos broke out, but Jace and Emmara managed to make their way through the Selesnyan and Golgari gates, however, upon reaching the Azorius gate, the pair were forced to separate as Lavinia arrested him for his long-overdue transgressions. A special trial was held with Isperia herself acting as judge. Jace explained everything he had discovered and how he intended to help. He pleads guilty, if for nothing else than to hurry the trial along. His penance was community service... to help the guild champions to complete the maze. Trying to reach Emmara, he passed through Dimir and Orzhov gates until he found her, fighting Teysa Karlov . He manipulated the Envoy's servants to attack each other, but the plan backfired, causing them to lash out against Teysa, who quickly wiped out her forces. Jace traded the rest of the maze's route for Teysa's delay, leaving her behind and proceeding to the Simic and Izzet gates with Emmara. Jace, the Living Guildpact At the Izzet gate, however, he found Ral Zarek waiting for him. Ral forced Jace to reveal his identity to Emmara, that Jace was a planeswalker as well. The news caused Emmara to lose the trust she had placed in him. Betrayed, Emmara proceeded through the gate, but Ral had no intention of letting Jace cross. He planned to kill the telepath instead. Jace very nearly lost the battle as Ral unleashed the full might of his preparations on the rival planeswalker, only surviving through the quick use of an illusion to lure away the Izzet guildmage. When he reached the Forum of Azor, all the maze-runners were assembled and attacking each other. He managed to stop them momentarily, but Lazav appeared and manipulated the champions into fighting once more. The bailiff appeared and seeing the situation, delivered the Supreme Verdict, which was to give every runner the ability to activate it. Jace connected their ten minds to prevent any from casting the verdict. He had merged their minds, letting them peer directly into each other's minds, but it was unraveling his mind in the process. Fortunately, the bailiff assisted him, easing the burden he had put upon himself. In doing so, the Bailiff had declared Jace the new Guildpact, the mediator who could understand the perspective of each of the guilds. Jace met Emmara some days later. She kissed him as a gesture of gratitude, but she wanted him to erase the memories she had about other worlds and planeswalkers. She could not share that with her guild, and to do her duty, she could have no secrets. Regretfully, Jace granted her request. Jace continued his wandering of the planes but spent much of his time rushing back to Ravnica. With Lavinia's help, the office of the guildpact was being maintained, but a threat delivered directly at him forced Jace to pay closer attention. The planeswalker Vraska manipulated Jace into a confrontation, in her bid to gain control of Jace as the Living Guildpact. Jace neutralized Vraska for the moment, but his attention was drawn once more off-world as something Vraska said to him took root. Leaving Lavinia in charge of the office once more, Jace left Ravnica to find what had befallen Garruk Wildspeaker. In his investigation following Vraska's ominous warnings, Jace learned that the corrupted Garruk intended to complete his transformation by returning to the Onakke Temple on Shandalar. Garruk's transformation would turn him into a demon and destroy the plane in the process. Jace realized that this would leave other worlds, including Ravnica, in danger. Jace took steps to hunt down Ob Nixilis on Zendikar to extract the hedron in his head which Nahiri had used to suppress the demonic ex-planeswalker's power. Jace arrived on Shandalar to make preparations for the upcoming battle where Garruk appeared shortly afterward. During the titanic battle, the temple began to crumble around them before Jace succeeded in implanting the hedron in Garruk and halting the curse of the chain veil. However, Jace was still unsure about Garruk's condition following the confrontation and sought him out. Masking himself as Liliana, Jace once more appeared before Garruk. However, the ruse was not effective and Garruk explained that though he was cursed, he enjoyed what he had become and wanted nothing more than to be left alone. With a final warning, Garruk told Jace that if he didn't heed his wishes, he wouldn't escape their next meeting. Curious about the Living Guildpact that had foiled his plans, Niv-Mizzet assigned Ral Zarek to trace Jace and research his many sudden disappearances. When Ral's co-worker, the Chamberlain Maree came close to exposing the existence of planeswalkers, Jace had to work together with Ral to successfully distract the Firemind. In the process, they discovered another planeswalker who appeared on Ravnica every day at a set time near the Boros Garrison. This was Gideon Jura . Feeling guilty for the Eldrazi release in Zendikar, Jace returns to the plane to help Trying to fight separate battles on two planes at once -- on Ravnica and Zendikar -- Gideon learned that the hedrons covering Zendikar held some power over the Eldrazi spawn , and that these hedrons were connected by leylines . Realizing he couldn't win the Battle for Zendikar on his own, he decided to recruit the master of leylines himself: Jace. After failing to persuade Chandra Nalaar to join them, the pair planeswalked to Zendikar again. There, they found out that Sea Gate had fallen. They arrived in time to rescue several survivors from Sea Gate and escort them to a safe zone. Having found out that Jori En -- Gideon's merfolk friend -- was trapped at Sea Gate, Gideon left to find her and to bring her back to Jace hoping that together they might be able to link Zendikar's leylines with the hedrons to find a way to stop the Eldrazi again. Jace and Jori En figured out that they had to travel to the Eye of Ugin in Akoum because that was where all the leylines connected. On their way there, the two were ambushed by the Eternal Pilgrims , a group of Kor who worshipped Mangeni Ula , their name for Ulamog . Barely escaping the titan itself, Jace and Jori En realized that Ulamog was heading for Sea Gate. They then decided to split up, Jace continuing to Akoum and Jori En heading back to alert Gideon of the coming disaster. Finally arriving at the Eye, Jace found Ugin himself rebuilding the chamber and the hedron network. The Spirit Dragon revealed how the network might be used to again immobilize the Eldrazi titans, but Jace realized that the same trick might instead serve as a first step in killing them. Ignoring Ugin's dire warnings, Jace left the Eye and made his way back to Sea Gate to pass this information on to Gideon. When Ulamog attacked, the Planeswalkers enacted a bold plan. While Gideon's troops and Kiora's forces held the city against this fresh assault, Nissa Revane called on the elemental power of the earth to raise sunken hedrons from the ground and move them into a ring around the Eldrazi titan. Jace activated the hedrons' magic, and Ulamog was trapped! Then everything collapsed. Ob Nixilis appeared, having followed Nissa from Bala Ged . The demon attacked the hedrons and interjected himself in the alignment, stealing the energies flowing within them to reignite his planeswalker's spark. As a final insult to the defenders and the plane itself, Ob Nixilis used his newfound power to coax the second Eldrazi Titan, Kozilek from its hiding spot under the plane's crust. Although Chandra Nalaar had also arrived to help, the defenders were scattering in panic. Earlier, Jace had attempted to direct Nissa to move several hedrons which would enable him to kill Ulamog but she ignored him and attempted to charge the titan herself with Ashaya. However, Kozilek and Ob Nixilis broke the hedron alignment and scattered the defenders. As Nissa fell to Ob Nixilis, he attempted to mentally manipulate the demon to leave but was countered and nearly killed by Ob Nixilis. Gideon attempted to rescue both Jace and Nissa but he too was defeated by the demon planeswalker. Ob Nixilis then took Gideon, Jace, and Nissa prisoner took them to a cave, and tortured them. However, Chandra Nalaar showed up and freed her friends. Their concerted attack managed to scare the demon away from Zendikar. \u201cFor the sake of the Multiverse, I will keep watch.\u201d The four planeswalkers realized that they were helpless against large threats on their own, but that they could stand against just about any force in the Multiverse by working together. Thus they swore an oath to stand together and the Gatewatch was created. Seeing that he was unable to keep his promise to Ugin to neither harm the Eldrazi nor allow them to escape from Zendikar, Jace decided to slay the Titans with the Gatewatch's and Kiora's help. After consulting with Nissa, he described the leyline pattern to her that would bind Kozilek and Ulamog to Zendikar, drawing the bulk of the Titans into the plane so that their energy could be dispersed into Zendikar, killing them in the process. To attract them, the remaining forces of Zendikar's defenders would pose as bait. While the plan worked at first, with Gideon keeping the Eldrazi swarms away from the army, Kiora clearing out any other swarms and Chandra supporting them, once the Eldrazi titans were anchored to Zendikar, their destructive essence threatened to assimilate Zendikar into themselves. Afraid, Kiora tried to persuade Nissa to release the Titans and allow them to flee, but Jace objected. Chandra offered to burn the Titans instead and after preventing Kiora from attacking Nissa, Jace agreed. The pyromancer then connected with the animist, allowing her to channel her pyromantic magic through Zendikar's leylines directly into the titans. In one brilliant blaze of flame, Ulamog and Kozilek were incinerated and destroyed, leaving only ashes raining from Zendikar's sky. Jace asks Liliana for help in finding Sorin Markov After the defeat of the Eldrazi titans, Jace and his friends were berated by Ugin for killing the ancient creatures. Ugin implied there could be consequences for the multiverse and that Sorin Markov (one of the other original Eldrazi planeswalker opponents) would be less forgiving. After consultation with his friends of the Gatewatch, Jace decided to investigate Sorin's whereabouts on Sorin's homeplane Innistrad , and recruit him as an ally against Nicol Bolas and other interplanar threats. His first stop was Liliana's estate, but she wouldn't or couldn't help him. At Markov Manor he found only death, destruction, and Tamiyo 's journal. After studying the journal, he came upon one of the Cryptoliths . Curious about where they might lead, he followed their trail, where he met a seemingly insane woman who rambled about the Drownyard Temple . His attempts to read her mind were not successful, as he was harried by several illusions of himself within his mind. When he reached the Drownyard Temple, he saw nothing. Tamiyo's Journal, however, seemed to indicate that the purpose of the cryptoliths that concentrated ley energy there was to relocate a large celestial object near Innistrad to pose as its additional moon. As he saw the undead tending to the Cryptoliths, he began to suspect Liliana of complicity in the fate of Markov Manor. As he saw angels clustering around the site, he heard a buzzing voice within his head that assured him that Liliana was behind this. Feeling betrayed, Jace decided to return to the planeswalker's manor. Jace finds Tamiyo's diary in the ruins of the Markov Mansion.. Still, under the influence of the cryptoliths , he tried to mentally assault Liliana in her mansion, but the Raven Man protected her and tried to convince her to kill him. Liliana, however, refused to, bringing Jace back to his senses by stating that she didn't wish to hurt him anymore. Jace articulated his suspicions, that Liliana was trying to use the redirected mana to free herself of the Chain Veil. During their talk, the maddening influence of the cryptoliths reasserted itself and Jace asked Liliana for directions to Thraben so he could confront Avacyn . In Thraben, Jace met Tamiyo herself. She cured him of the madness, and he persuaded her to face Avacyn with him. Tamiyo was reluctant to destroy Avacyn because the archangel warded the entire plane against unknown evils. They had to confront Avacyn anyway, and almost lost their fight. In the end, Sorin Markov showed up and destroyed his creation. After the last protection of Innistrad had vanished, Jace and Tamiyo witnessed the arrival of the third Eldrazi titan, Emrakul . Jace immediately went to fetch the Gatewatch . With the Gatewatch assembled, they hoped to contain Emrakul in the same way they did the other titans. However, as the leylines were already controlled by the cryptoliths, Nissa could not use the seal that she had used on Zendikar. They decided to try and use two smaller leylines and link them to Chandra to assault Emrakul. After finding Tamiyo's diary, Jace begins to investigate what is happening in Innistrad. The plan did not work, because the Gatewatch found themselves under constant assault from Emrakul's corrupted minions and Innistrad's leylines did not obey Nissa in the same way those on Zendikar did. They were saved by Liliana, who arrived with an army of undead that she had raised on the way to Thraben. Despite initial objections from Nissa and Gideon, they came to work together. Under the weight of Emrakul's mental influence, Jace was forced to take the other members of the Gatewatch under his mental protection. Within his mental domain, he witnessed the fears of his friends and eventually came to a chamber of his mind where he was greeted by an angelic figure resembling the Zendikari deity Emeria . The figure proved very polite and conversed with him, even challenging him to a match of chess. While Jace won the game, all his figures transformed and turned against his king by the end of the game. Realizing that the Emeria-creature was his own attempt to make sense of Emrakul's attempt at communication, Jace fled into another room of his mind, where he met a representation of himself that upheld the spell that protected his friends from the mental assault from the titan. Communicating with the rest of the Gatewatch, Jace combined forces with Nissa and Tamiyo to trap Emrakul in Innistrad's moon , while Gideon and Chandra would keep the other Eldrazi away from them. Though their attempts were fruitful at first, the spell nearly failed until Tamiyo used another spell-scroll that managed to seal Emrakul. Later, Jace and Tamiyo met in private. Tamiyo revealed that she had been overtaken by Emrakul when she had cast the second spell, that the spell she had used was not the original that had been written on the scroll, and that Emrakul had wanted to be sealed in the moon. Deeply unsettled, the two parted ways, with Jace pondering what Emrakul's greater plan was. In the three months that followed, the Gatewatch made their headquarters on Ravnica , within Jace's apartments. Thanks to the aid of Tamiyo, they received an emissary from the Consulate of Kaladesh , the Vedalken Dovin Baan . The Vedalken wanted to hire the Gatewatch to provide protection for an Inventor's Fair that would take place in Ghirapur. Liliana, however, quickly made it clear that the Gatewatch intended to combat other planeswalkers and similar extraplanar threats, not local unrest. Additionally, several influential members of the Azorius Senate of Ravnica had been petrified, leaving Jace to believe that Vraska , a rival planeswalker, could have returned. Meeting at a Rakdos Carnarium with Ral Zarek, the Izzet mage informed him that Project Lightning Bug , despite no longer receiving attention from Niv-Mizzet, still showed when and where a planeswalker entered Ravnica. Ral Zarek told him that Vraska had indeed been on Ravnica, but then planeswalked seemingly into nothing. He warned Jace to not leave Ravnica for some time, only to be interrupted by Liliana Vess, who reported that she had seen Tezzeret on Kaladesh. Jace fetched Gideon and left Ravnica behind. On Kaladesh, the Gatewatch, along with their new ally Ajani Goldmane , prepared to intervene in the quicksmithing duel between Tezzeret and Pia Nalaar , Chandra's mother. When the Gatewatch revealed itself and faced Tezzeret and his metallic creations, Jace realized that the whole thing had been arranged, since Tezzeret's mind was protected against his telepathy, meaning that he had anticipated at least his presence. Joining the rest of the Gatewatch in their support of the Renegades , Jace mainly undertook reconnaissance missions and worked with sky pirates to hamper the aether supply of the Consulate. He used his illusions to camouflage Renegade ships and was involved in taking down the Skysovereign by luring sky whales to its location. After Tezzeret was ousted from the plane and Liliana had learned that he had taken his orders from Bolas on Amonkhet, Jace recommended traveling directly to the plane since Bolas was more powerful and smarter than every member of the Gatewatch combined and offering him time to prepare would only decrease their chances to harm him. Jace's Defeat at the hands of Bolas After arriving on Amonkhet, the Gatewatch found themselves at first overwhelmed by the local wildlife and undead. After reaching Naktamun , Jace managed to convince one of the guardians of the Hekma that they were part of the native population, despite their outlandish clothing. Together with Liliana, he discovered a tomb. Inside, Liliana and Jace witnessed the assembly line process of creation of the Anointed out of those who had died in combat, as well as a mural that implied Razaketh 's involvement in the afterlife. Learning that Liliana mainly came to Amonkhet to kill the demon, Jace accused her of betraying their trust. As they spoke, Temmet arrived and set the mummies against them after becoming suspicious of their origins. With Jace's aid, the two managed to escape. After the Hour of Revelation had passed, Jace and the rest of the Gatewatch found Liliana under Razaketh's spell. Coming to her aid, he summoned illusions to distract the demon and allowed Liliana to kill the demon. Seeing the chaos and destruction that Bolas's new Eternal army and enslaved gods unleashed upon the people, the Gatewatch knew they had to act immediately. As they faced the dragon, Jace attempted to penetrate Bolas' mind, only to find it strangely resembling the defenses of another being he could not clearly remember . Before he could ponder the implications of this, Bolas mocked the telepath for his presumption and opened his mental defenses enough for Jace to fall into the dragon's mind. Jace's mind was crushed and he instinctively planeswalked away to avoid mind-death. Jace without memories and imprisoned in Ixalan While confronting Nicol Bolas in a telepathic battle, Jace briefly recalls Emrakul (although not named directly). Emrakul's memory had been wiped from everyone's minds via magical enchantment, so as he begins to recall Emrakul his memories begin erasing themselves. As his mind falls into darkness, Jace instinctively planeswalks away. Jace didn't consciously choose where to go, but his destination was the result of pieces of memory as they fled from his mind. More than anything, it was an instinctive urge to leave that made him get sucked down to one specific very hidden place: Ixalan . When he arrived he had absolutely no memory of who or what he was. When he instinctively tried to planeswalk away, he found to his shock that he could not leave. Slowly, surface memories returned to him, although in a confused manner, manifesting as illusions. At first, Jace had no idea what these things were and feared for his sanity, until he rediscovered that he had magical talent. Working to sustain himself, the planeswalker managed to construct a raft and leave the island he was stranded on. The Belligerent crew. After several days, he was fished up by Vraska and her crew. When the gorgon realized that he did not know who he was, she spared him. Jace lived with her crew, relearning skills and later aiding Vraska's pirates in a raid against a ship from the Legion of Dusk with his illusions. Slowly, Vraska and Jace began to develop a new relationship, based on a sense of respect and attraction. After The Golden City revealed itself, Vraska and Jace fell in its churning waters. To Vraska's horror, the shock caused Jace's memories partially to return. Even his forgotten memories of his childhood on Vryn and the tutelage under Alhammaret returned, although not his battle on Amonkhet against Bolas. He forgave Vraska for past grievances. As he ascended to the Golden City, Jace learned of the memory of Ugin and a mental command that the Spirit Dragon had laid in his mind in case that someone would access the memory of him: forget about him and planeswalk to Ixalan. While he still could not recollect who had read his mind (other than that it was a golden dragon). On reaching the edge of the city, Jace and Vraska witnessed the rise of a gigantic dinosaur . As they walked through the city, they reached a gigantic door, engraved with the symbol of the Azorius Senate . When Jace opened it, he and Vraska beheld the form of Azor , who reminded Jace much of Alhammaret. The ancient parun of the Ravnican guild read Vraska's mind as she prepared to attack him, but Jace managed to block him. Proclaiming himself as the Living Guildpact, Azor referred to him as a \"fail-safe\". From Azor, Jace learned of his plan to imprison Nicol Bolas, with his memories of the dragon finally returning, along with a hint of his plans that centered on Ravnica. On Vraska's urgings, he sentenced Azor to be the caretaker of Useless Island for his meddlings in the affairs of Ixalan and countless other planes, enhanced by the power of his status as Living Guildpact. Vraska allows Jace to seal some of her memories so Bolas doesn't discover his plans Lamenting that the Gatewatch had failed in its intent, Jace shared what he knew with Vraska, who in turn revealed to him her objective. To keep hidden the fact that they had met, Vraska asked Jace to temporarily remove her memories of him. This would lead Bolas to trust her and she could betray him at the right moment. Jace would warn the guild leaders and devise a plan to stop the invasion after meeting with the rest of the Gatewatch on Dominaria . On Dominaria, Jace found Gideon, Chandra, and Liliana travelling with an elderly planeswalker on the skyship Weatherlight . When he failed to persuade them to abandon plans to kill Belzenlok and focus on Bolas instead, Jace left his friends and the plane again. Jace loses his Living Guildpact powers Jace returned to Zendikar and attempted to convince Nissa to rejoin the Gatewatch, to no avail. Jace traveled with the Gatewatch to Ravnica for the final confrontation with Bolas, and immediately became trapped there due to Bolas 's use of the Immortal Sun . Jace lost the power of the Living Guildpact as soon as Bolas's Planar Bridge opened on the Chamber of the Guildpact, disrupting the leylines that were the foundation of the Guildpact's magic. Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, he fought against the Eternals of Bolas' Dreadhorde . During the invasion, the trapped planeswalkers got together with Ravnican leaders to strategize. At Jace's recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. Jace, Jaya, Teferi, and Vivien volunteered to assassinate Liliana. Jace had a lot of conflicting feelings about their mission: rationally, he knew that it was the right thing to do, but he still cared for her and wished that there was a way to help her. When they found Liliana, Teferi warped time around her, slowing her ability to react, defend herself, or strike back at her attackers. This allowed Jaya and Vivien to badly wound her with fire, arrows, and animal spirits, although the Onakke spirits in Liliana's Chain Veil protected her. Nonetheless, they almost succeeded, but Bolas stepped in and saved Liliana by destroying the buildings they were standing on. Fortunately, Teferi saved himself and the other three planeswalkers by slowing their falls. Later, Jace reunited with Vraska. He tried to restore her memories, only to find that they'd already been restored by a Golgari telepath. Vraska confessed that even though she was fully aware of the threat Bolas posed, she still murdered Isperia in a fit of rage, despite knowing that it would help further Bolas' plans. Jace forgave her and promised to get together with her if they made it out of the war alive. Jace witnessed Gideon sacrificing his life to save Liliana. When Chandra tried to kill Liliana (believing she'd killed Gideon), Jace stopped her by explaining the situation. After Bolas' defeat, Jace was telepathically contacted by Ugin, who came to take Bolas to the Meditation Realm to prevent him from coming back to life on Ravnica. At Ugin's request, Jace used an illusion to hide the fact that Ugin had taken Bolas' body, concealing Ugin's presence from everyone and making them believe that Bolas' corpse had disintegrated instead. Jace then ordered Saheeli to disable the Immortal Sun (which had been reactivated as part of Gideon's plan to kill Bolas), allowing Ugin to planeswalk away with Bolas' body and allowing Liliana to escape certain death at the hands of the assembled Ravnicans. Jace survived the battle and was present during the Planewide Celebration that followed, where he and Vraska finally shared a kiss. Jace participated in the memorial service for Gideon on Theros . By command of the new Living Guildpact, who feared their interference, Jace and Chandra were kept out of the loop concerning the assignments of Vraska, Kaya, and Ral Zarek to pursue and kill Dovin Baan, Liliana, and Tezzeret respectively. Although Jace and Vraska consummated their love, her lying, and her choice to put the Golgari rather than Jace first resulted in the couple growing apart again. They broke up after Vraska accused him of still having feelings for Liliana. Singing City music almost drives Jace insane. When Nissa Revane found out the lithomancer Nahiri was trying to restore the former glory of the Makindi Empire on Zendikar at the cost of its current life and beauty, she visited Jace on Ravnica to ask for his help. Quickly growing frustrated with his desire to intellectually understand Nahiri's artifacts rather than to rush into action, she left again to take her stand against the Kor planeswalker. Feeling he had to fulfill his Gatewatch oath, Jace decided to follow her. After meeting up, they followed Nahiri to the Murasa Skyclave . While climbing up to the skyclave on a thorn ladder Jace and Nissa witnessed Akiri falling and Nissa managed to save the Kor warrior. Returning to the ground, they saw Nahiri leaving. Jace determined that Nahiri was going to the Singing City . Nissa abandoned Jace in her haste to pursue the lithomancer. Akiri was distrustful of the mythical \"walkers\" but decided to guide Jace to the Singing City anyway. In return, he pointed out the location of Kaza and Orah to her. Deep in the city, Jace found Nahiri, but both were overwhelmed by the city's unsettling and haunting music. After Jace managed to save them by blocking out all sounds with a new spell, they came to an uneasy understanding. Jace began to comprehend Nahiri's vision of an orderly Zendikar with no roil and great prosperous cities. It reminded him of Ravnica and was beautiful to him. Nahiri explained that the old city had a magical focal point from where she could channel the Core's energy all over Zendikar through the leylines . Jace promised to not hinder her in her endeavor to save Zendikar if she promised not to use the Core until they had studied its mechanism in more detail, perhaps on Ravnica. He knew that if he was ever going to unlock the mysteries of the Core, he was going to have to understand how it was activated. What if it was going to be a useful weapon in the battles to come, its mysterious power had to be quantified first. Arriving at the focal point they found that Nissa had located it earlier and had destroyed it with help from Ashaya and her other elementals . He realized that Nissa felt betrayed. She was angry that he had teamed up with Nahiri to research the Lithoform Core and he was unable to prevent the following all-out battle. Nissa and her Elementals attacked both Jace and Nahiri. Their force was so overwhelming that Jace and Nahiri had to retreat into the Singing City. Barricading the entrance, Nahiri began to collect power from the stones. When Jace tried to persuade her to flee to Ravnica with him, she refused. When she tried to remove him from the equation, Jace turned the tables on her and took control of her mind. Taking the Lithoform Core from Nahiri, he tried to find Nissa to tell her that he would take it to Ravnica to study it. Before he could make his argument, he was caught by Ashaya who took the Core and handed it to Nissa herself. As Nissa held the Core she found that it was an ancient piece of Zendikar's soul that spoke to her, arguing that she could use it to restore Zendikar to power. When Jace tried to take control of her mind, and Nahiri returned with a vengeance, Nissa used the power. Jace witnessed how she flattened the Singing City into dust and restored Zendikar's soil. With Nissa, Jace realized that the Core had served its purpose. It had undone damage to the plane. Zendikar was healing, turning into something healthier, stronger than it was before the battle with the Eldrazi. Though the scars were still there, they were memories now, not their defining features. Nissa left, still feeling betrayed by Jace. He picked up the inert Core and watched Nissa disappear, hoping he could one day restore her trust in him. Jace Beleren organized Ravnica 's defense against the New Phyrexian threat, lobbying for support from the guilds. Afterward, he gathered the Gatewatch's planeswalker allies on Ravnica and Dominaria to prepare for the attack on New Phyrexia. When Teferi's spirit was shunted to Zhalfir by the Temporal Anchor , Kaya allowed Jace to witness the detonation of the Sylex through her so that he could learn the process of its activation. For a bittersweet moment, Jace believed he could still save his love. A moment was all Vraska needed. \u201cFor the glory of Phyrexia,\u201d she whispered. Arriving on New Phyrexia, he found that the group had been partially incapacitated and scattered by a planar shield erected by Elesh Norn, including severing the mindlink he had created to connect the planeswalkers. However, several of them congregated in the Furnace Layer to meet up with Koth , and decided to carry on with the plan to deactivate Realmbreaker with the Sylex . The team of planeswalkers descended to the Dross Pits , where Elspeth provided them with Halo to counteract the effects of the Necrogen . However, the elixir also restored his broken mindlink, reconnecting Jace and Vraska, and causing him immense pain. After recovering, Jace's mind was focused on Vraska, who had called him for help. Abandoning the group, he set out to find her. Because he carried the Sylex , the complete group set out after him.\nFinding Vraska in Sheoldred's Coliseum , the group found she was heavily wounded and already infected with Phyresis . Too late to save her, Jace chose to stay behind with her and relive their happy moments on Ravnica in his mind. Lingering too long, Vraska succumbed to the Phyrexian influence and infected Jace in turn. The others tried to escape but were quickly overwhelmed by the black Phyrexians. Nahiri, who was also infected, decided to sacrifice herself for the greater good. With a mighty magical blast, she exploded the Coliseum and dropped it with all remaining planeswalkers on the Fair Basilica . Nearer to their goal, the infected Jace rejoined them and volunteered to carry the Sylex to the Seedcore . \"Free will is an illusion so perfect it fooled even me. I know better now.\" Jace's compleation progressed steadily, but he staunchly held on to his sanity, as well as the Sylex. Evidence of his infection also became clearer. His right arm became fully mechanized, slight bits of metal grew on his face, and mechanical eyes attached to cables sprouted from his body. Traveling through the Mycosynth Gardens , the group reached the Seedcore and Realmbreaker , just as it established its connection to other planes through the Blind Eternities . Jace prepared to activate the Sylex, but Kaya expressed concerns that the collateral damage of the Sylex blast had the potential to destroy one or more planes, or even the Eternities themselves. Jace acknowledged the possibility, but moved forward anyway, considering these planes the price for an un- compleated Multiverse. Kaya and Kaito attacked him to interrupt the blast, but Jace evaded them with illusions. He ran his thumbnail across his forehead, dripping the ichor from the wound into the bowl. He also poured his grief, fury, the suffering and sorrow-drenched agony of all Mirrodin, regret for the Multiverse, and the love of Vraska into the sylex. Although he believed the words to be unimportant, he spoke the bowl's inscription to complete the ritual. As he was about to set off the Sylex, Elspeth , who had been fighting the compleated Ajani to buy them time, burst into the chamber, impaled Jace with her halo-infused blade, and seized the Sylex, planeswalking away. Once Elesh Norn reached the Seedcore, Jace's lifeless body rose again, becoming fully part of the Flesh Singularity. When Norn directed the other planeswalkers toward their designated planes, Jace left of his own accord. Norn believed he knew the objective that she desired, but exactly what he went to do is undisclosed. After Vraska was struck by Ral Zarek 's haemalectric switch while invading Ravnica and the Phyrexian influence faded from her mind, she saw a vision of Jace. Whether this was a delusion, a memory, a psychic facsimile, or a real telepathic projection from Jace is unknown. Ajani Goldmane surmised that Jace was dead, but noted that his body had never been found. The Filigree Sylex , created by Saheeli Rai on Dominaria and activated in the core of New Phyrexia . After the Hall of the Hospitallers of the Frozen Heart raided Duskmantle , one of the members put Jace into a coma and delivered him to the hospital. There, the abbot of the hospital used Jace's mind to reach out to the hospital's goddess, Marit Lage , still trapped in the Ronom Glacier in the Blind Eternities . Using his mind as a beacon, Marit Lage was able to propel herself toward Ravnica, which was to fulfill the prophecy of a comet destroying Ravnica. He was rescued by Ral Zarek, Vraska, Kaya, Aurelia, Lavinia, and Niv-Mizzet. Later, the abbot's undead right-hand man tried to kill Jace but was dispatched by Tezzeret, who wanted the glory of killing Jace himself. Jace and the guildmaster planeswalkers learned of Tezzeret's latest plan to kill him: Marit Lage was now tuned into Jace's ambient telepathic signals and would follow him until she crashed down onto him, dooming both him and whatever plane he was on at the time. In response, Ral concocted a plan that would require the powers of Jace, Vraska, Liliana, Kaya, and himself to work in concert with one another. The ruined city of Naktamun was selected as the location for Marit Lage to impact Jace, and they rounded up as many allied planeswalkers as they could to fend off the undead and horrors of the desert until the ritual was complete. Jace temporarily melded the minds of Vraska, Kaya, and Ral, allowing them to articulate Ral's genius plan for the dead authoritatively. He then channeled the instruction from that united mind to Liliana, who delivered it to the swarming mass of zombies. That instruction: Serve Marit Lage. With servants who couldn't go mad and commit suicide, Marit Lage could finally be content with her latest body of worshipers. As Marit Lage finally came plummeting toward Jace, all the other planeswalkers, save Vraska, fled to Dominaria. When Kaya realized Vraska had stayed behind, she returned and quickly ghosted Vraska to Dominaria against her will. When Jace died, his specter retained the planeswalking skill. However, his other powers became muted by his new form's limitations. He could now hear the whisperings of the minds of ghosts around him, instead of those of the living, and his illusions only appeared in mirrors. He visited Theros, Innistrad, Kamigawa, and Azgol, learning as much as he could about his new form, and then returned to Ravnica, where he met Niv-Mizzet's ghost and learned of Tezzeret's diabolical deeds. Realizing he had to somehow inform the living, he planeswalked to Kaldheim, where he began following Niko Aris . Niko, thinking this was a specter of death issued by Klothys to seal Niko's fate, wandered the planes searching for Chandra and Kaya, and was followed by Jace. When Chandra, Niko, and Garruk clashed with Davriel and Tibalt in Emeria , Davriel unwittingly gave Jace's specter the power to utter some words, who told Niko to save Ravinca. Confused by this, Chandra, Niko, and Garruk embarked on a quest for the Cauldron of Eternity , which granted Jace enough strength to speak to mortals once again. He brought them up to speed and then summoned the ghost of Niv-Mizzet. Following the Battle for Ravnica, Jace moved into one of the mindless clones Tezzeret had created for torturing Vraska. In the story Following a Dream , Jace spends an undisclosed length of time on the plane of Lorwyn studying the peculiar nature of dreamstuff in that world. During this visit, he had a brief mental encounter with the flamekin Ashling , though she never became aware of his presence. As he was born more than a decade after the Great Aurora , it is likely this story is non-canon. Jace narrates the trailers for Return to Ravnica and Shadows over Innistrad , and appears in the ManaStrike , Magic SpellSlingers , and Phyrexia: All Will Be One trailers. The designs for the guildless clothing on Ravnica was, in part, inspired by Jace's clothing. Jace appeared in the book Test of Metal but much of the novel has since become contested canon, given the notable departures in both his character and certain events. With that, these departures have been placed in trivia rather than the main article. \u2014 Possessing all of Tezzeret's knowledge about the artificer's life, Jace set a series of traps to try and locate him should he have survived Kamigawa. When Tezzeret stumbled into such a trap upon Esper, Jace was alerted and went there to try and deal with him. Tezzeret got the upper hand, infecting Jace with an etherium device that prevented him from using any of his abilities, but the device was removed by Nicol Bolas later, as part of Tezzeret's plans. Once again free, the artificer and the telepath immediately rekindled their war. Bolas intervened again, unbeknownst to Jace, and sent Tezzeret to Mirrodin . The proprietary font that's been used from Magic 2015 onward is called Beleren, after Jace. Jace, the Mind Sculptor is also featured as a card in the Japanese TCG Duel Masters , which is published by Wizards of the Coast as well. R&D videos for Jace Vryn's Prodigy / Jace Telepath Unbound refer to Jace as the most powerful planeswalker in the Magic Origins set. In the video game Magic: The Gathering Arena , Jace is voiced by Nolan North . In contrast to the other compleated planeswalkers and creatures that exhibit characteristics of the color that compleated them, Jace exhibits the physical characteristic of the Phyrexians of his natural color (the Chrome Host's optical tendrils) despite being infected by a member of the Etched Host, Vraska. It is unknown whether this has in-universe meaning or was an oversight in artistic direction.
