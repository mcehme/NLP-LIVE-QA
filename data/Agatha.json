{"text": "Agatha , \"the Hungry,\" was a powerful witch from Eldraine . She was the sister of Eriette , Hylda , and an unnamed witch who was the birth mother of the Kenrith twins. Agatha appeared kind and motherly, but in reality she had a bestial nature. She had wicked, piercing violet eyes and sharpened teeth. She had long, clawlike, red-painted fingernails and wore jewelry made of human teeth. She enchanted her victims through her singing, and was enthralled with the sound of her voice. Agatha and her sisters Eriette and Hylda helped the faerie Talion cast the Wicked Slumber to end the Phyrexian Invasion of Eldraine . In exchange, Talion gave her the Vile Cauldron, which allowed her to boil down the essence of those within. She began influencing the forest animals from her cabin near Dunbarrow, turning them more vicious and carnivorous. Kellan pushes Agatha into her own cauldron. Months later, she enchanted the woodsman Peter , turning him into the Wolf Knight. With Peter's help, she captured Syr Imodane and prepared to cook her into a stew. Kellan slew the witch by pushing her into her cauldron and boiling her alive. A cannibalistic collector of children in the forest, Agatha is based on the witch of Hansel and Gretel .
