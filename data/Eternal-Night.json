{"text": "The Eternal Night is an event feared by the citizens of Innistrad : a night that may never end. It is an unnatural darkness with a weird magical hoarfrost covering the world, and causing strange reflections in the sky. When Emrakul entered the Innistrad Moon , the day/night balance of Innistrad was totally disturbed. With the sun rising later and setting sooner each day, and the days getting colder, the werewolves went mad and tried to take control of the plane. Crops started dwindling, the chill was bad for them, and they weren't getting enough light either. The citizens turned to the hope of the Harvesttide festival and a ritual with warlocks at the Celestus to restore the balance. After a battle with werewolves the witches tried to finish the ritual, but Olivia Voldaren suddenly appeared, interrupting the ritual and taking the Moonsilver Key with her. This left the ritual unfinished, and the Eternal Night a fact. During the Eternal Night, the Moon of Innistrad was kept in place by ancient magic. With Sorin Markov 's assistance, Arlinn and the Gatewatch managed to recover the Key. They hastened their return to the Celestus to complete the ritual. When the Moonsilver Key and the Sungold Lock were joined, a flash of light flooded the Celestus. It was warm as sunlight, and the Celestus roared to life, shaking off centuries of overgrowth. With each passing of the arms, the light increased in intensity. Eventually only a single column remained, running from the Celestus to the moon itself. When the light faded, already begun her descent. The balance between night and day was restored. Referred to:"}
