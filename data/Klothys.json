{"text": "Klothys is the God of Fate and Destiny on Theros . She is associated with red and green mana . Klothys has a mask on either side of her face, which implies she's a goddess with three aspects. Her long hair twists around her horns. She holds a large distaff with a spear-like tip in her left hand, which is laden with strands of her hair. In her right hand, she dangles a suspended spindle , which she uses to spin her gathered hair into the threads of fate. Her eyes are covered to signify that Destiny is blind and impartial. Her thumb has a sharp golden nail to cut the threads of fate. She, alongside Kruphix , is one of the oldest gods. Long ago, the titans had been sealed away in the Underworld by the combined might of the gods, and it was Klothys who volunteered to serve as their eternal jailer. While Erebos ruled his realm beyond death, Klothys acted as an eternal seal to ensure the titans remained imprisoned. The aftermath of Xenagos \u2019 ascension to godhood, his death, and the death of Elspeth had revealed a disturbing reality: the gods were replaceable. As war broke out among the gods themselves, Erebos was consumed by his hatred of Heliod , and so Erebos began to lose control of the souls of his realm. When countless souls dared defy fate to reverse their deaths, Klothys was livid. In reaction to all those who sought to reverse their deaths, Klothys dispatched numerous Agents of Fate to ensure they did not succeed. These Agents wielded Klothys's thread in pursuit of their goals. To properly deal with the soul of the Planeswalker Elspeth Tirel , a special agent would be needed. For this task, Klothys created Calix . As the God of Destiny's greatest masterpiece, Calix was solely created to carry out the will of Klothys. Associated cards: Depicted in: Quoted or referred to: The Fates were earlier depicted in the Theros block on Triad of Fates and Fate Unraveler . One of them was named Andrasteia . Although she and her sisters controlled many things in the destinies of all in Theros \u2014 even at times the gods themselves \u2014 there were rules that should not be bent, and a few that must never, ever be broken. There are also fate weavers, such as Tymna , humans who have learned the magic of the Fates and can manipulate the threads for their machinations. The name and character of Klothys is inspired by Clotho , one of the Moirai or Fates, Greek mythological incarnations of destiny; Clotho spun the threads of destiny, while Lachesis measured and Atropos cut. Klothys also seems to take aspects of Persephone , namely being a female deity confined to the underworld, and Hecate , a chthonic triple goddess. Klothys may also be based on Ananke , the primordial goddess of inevitability and fate, even holding a spindle, and wife of Chronus , primordial of time (not to be confused with Cronos the titan). Klothys's design also seems to be partially based on Lady Justice or Iustitia as the Roman blindfolded goddess, whose Greek equivalent is Dike . The role of guardian in the Underworld is inspired by Campe , a female monster guard in Tartarus ."}
