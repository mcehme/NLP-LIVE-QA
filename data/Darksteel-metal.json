{"text": "Darksteel metal is a magical indestructible material found on Mirrodin . It is jet-black and has characteristic golden streaks of energy surrounding it. Forging darksteel metal to create tools or constructs is an extremely difficult art, as the same properties which make the material indestructible make it impossible to forge by traditional means. Jin-Gitaxias erroneously believed that the metal must be shaped immediately upon forging. The most that Tezzeret could surmise was that the reality must be bent around the forming metal to shape it, but only the Vulshok knew the correct rituals to do so, with no clear recorded knowledge. Exposure to glistening oil for weeks or months eventually convert it into blightsteel . These compounded difficulties mean few blightsteel constructs have been made, with only one confirmed ( Blightsteel Colossus ).
