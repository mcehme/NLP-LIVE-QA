{"text": "The Myojin of Life's Web ( Japanese: \u751f \u7db2 \u660e \u795e ; r\u014dmaji : Seim\u014d My\u014djin ) was the kami of the fundamental force of creation and the patron spirit of all green -aligned things of the plane of Kamigawa , including the kannushi priests, budoka monks and the orochi . She was a patron spirit of Jukai Forest. She manifested as a woman-faced figure with a face like polished wood and vines and leaves making up her body. Myojin of Life's Web wanted to restore the balance on Kamigawa by eliminating Princess Michiko whose birth (connected with Konda 's crime and therefore the cause of the Kami War ), she saw as an abomination. She ordered her orochi to capture the princess, though she was later liberated by Toshiro Umezawa . When the Myojin confronted the ochimusha and demanded Michiko, Toshi refused and fought her with the help of the Myojin of Night's Reach 's blessings. He silenced the throats of her worshippers, cutting her from her source of sustenance. Defeated, her body withered and fell apart into deadwood. She later was seen blessing and helping her orochi in battle with soratami , though this time only her face manifested.  It is not known how it is related to the Myojin of Towering Might which also represents an aspect of green magic. Associated cards: Quoted or referred to:"}
