{"text": "Kaito is a human cyber Ninja and Planeswalker from Kamigawa . He made his debut in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty . Kaito is a young man of twenty-four years with shaven hair, usually dressed in black and dark blue clothes. He is trained as a samurai by the kitsune Light-Paws and Swift-Arm . He wears a device strapped along his chin and cheek that allows him to interface with the kami Himoto in the form of a drone or a tanuki mask. Kaito is now a master ninja who augments his skills as an infiltrator with innate telekinetic powers. Some substances, such as glistening oil resist Kaito's telekinesis, causing him major headaches after prolonged interaction. Kaito is a skilled pickpocket, fighter, and telekinetic, and has access to blue and black mana . His sword can change form, if needed. Kaito Shizuki pursues a personal agenda of technological progress on his homeworld of Kamigawa, determined to make the plane a better place for himself and his family. Kaito is a risk-taker at heart, and despite his childhood friendship with Kamigawa's emperor, he has no qualms about breaking rules or flouting authority to accomplish his goals. The Wanderer and Kaito have known each other since childhood. Kaito and his twin sister Eiko 's parents had an accident at the Towashi lab where they worked, in which they were both exposed to radiation. Their father attempted to heal their mother with unapproved black market med-tech, but was arrested by Imperials and died in prison shortly before his wife. Kaito and Eiko grew up as orphans in the Imperial Palace, learning together under Light-Paws for five years before he became the sparring partner of the young emperor , whom he quickly befriended. He was given an origami crane drone by the moonfolk Futurist Katsumasa . Kaito and Tamiyo confront Jin-Gitaxias in Otawara . When Kaito was fourteen, the emperor ( Wanderer ) disappeared after being attacked by the planeswalker Tezzeret in the temple of Kyodai . Because the other Imperials didn't believe what he had seen, Kaito left the castle and joined the Hyozan Reckoners to search for answers on his own. After spending a year with the Reckoners, Kaito was sent on a mission to steal the work of the futurist Tameshi , who had created a mechanized origami tanuki robot to interface with a kami; Himoto , the Kami of the Spark . Kaito's planeswalker spark ignited when he came into contact with the kami, who now lives in Tameshi's robot. Tameshi and the nascent planeswalker became best friends, and worked together as mentor and pupil under the Futurists for nine years until Kaito learned that his friend had betrayed both him and their organization to work for the Phyrexian praetor Jin-Gitaxias . After reuniting with the Wanderer on Kamigawa, he and the moonfolk Planeswalker Tamiyo fought Jin-Gitaxias and Tezzeret to keep the returned emperor and their plane safe. After the Asari Uprisers had been beaten and the Phyrexians returned to New Phyrexia , Kaito planeswalked away to continue his search for the missing emperor and her unstable spark. Kaito and the Wanderer joined the Gatewatch and other assembled planeswalkers to support the Mirrans ' efforts against Elesh Norn on New Phyrexia . When they planeswalked to New Phyrexia, Kaito was incapacitated by Norn's defense barrier and almost died in the sands of the Glorious Facade . After being rescued by The Wanderer, he traveled with Tyvar and Nahiri to Mirrex . The Wanderer couldn't accompany them, because the barrier prevented her from anchoring on New Phyrexia. Meeting up with Koth and several others, they agreed to carry on with the plan to deactivate Realmbreaker with the Sylex . The team of planeswalkers descended with Melira to the Dross Pits , where Elspeth provided them with Halo to counteract the effects of the Necrogen . However, Jace inexplicably reacted adversely to the potent elixir and collapsed. After recovering, Jace's mind was focused on Vraska, whom he perceived to need help. Abandoning the group, he set out to find her. Because he carried the Sylex , the complete group set out after him. Finding Vraska in Sheoldred's Coliseum , they found she was heavily wounded and already infected with Phyresis . Too late to save her, Jace chose to stay behind with her and relive their happy moments on Ravnica in his mind. Lingering too long, Vraska succumbed to the Phyrexian influence and infected Jace in turn. The others tried to escape but were quickly overwhelmed by the black Phyrexians. Nahiri , who was also infected, decided to sacrifice herself for the greater good. With a mighty magical blast, she exploded the Coliseum and dropped it with all remaining planeswalkers on the Fair Basilica . Nearer to their goal, the infected Jace rejoined them and volunteered to activate the Sylex . Traveling through the Mycosynth Gardens , Kaito, Kaya, and Jace reached the Seedcore just as Realmbreaker established its connection to other planes through the Blind Eternities . Jace prepared to activate the Sylex, but Kaya expressed concerns that the collateral damage of the Sylex blast had the potential to destroy one or more planes, or even the Eternities themselves. Jace acknowledged the possibility, but moved forward anyway, considering these planes the price for an un- compleated Multiverse. Kaya and Kaito attacked him to interrupt the blast, but Jace evaded them with illusions. Just as Jace began to activate the sylex, Elspeth , who had been fighting the compleated Ajani to buy them time, burst into the chamber, impaled Jace with her halo-infused blade, and seized the Sylex, planeswalking away. Kaito was left alone with Kaya and Tyvar, the three of them watching Phyrexian armies march to invade other worlds. Suddenly, Elesh Norn entered the chamber alongside Tamiyo and the newly compleated Nahiri and Nissa. Norn animated Jace's now-fully compleated body, causing Luxior to fall out of it. Kaito swiftly grabbed the sword. Then, she invited the three to yield to the glory of Phyrexia. Kaito sarcastically replied that he was good as the invasion began in full force. After the three witnessed Nahiri being sent to Zendikar to conquer her homeplane, they were able to escape. Norn wanted them to tell their allies of their inescapable fate. After reconvening with their allies, Kaito left with Kaya to defend Kamigawa . Returning to Kamigawa to protect his homeplane, Kaito fought Tamiyo but was almost overwhelmed. The Wanderer once again returned just in time to save him and kill Tamiyo. In the aftermath of the invasion, Kaito and the Wanderer led reconstruction efforts on Kamigawa. Kaito is the primary protagonist of the teaser, cinematic, and animated trailers for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty . He carries a device strapped along his chin and cheek that allows him to interface with the kami Himoto in the form of a drone or a tanuki mask. Before meeting Himoto, Kaito carried an origami crane drone he received from Katsumasa. Luxior, a sword capable of producing Halo . Originally belonged to Elspeth before she left it in the body of the compleated Jace and Kaito retrieved it. Associated cards: Depicted in:"}
