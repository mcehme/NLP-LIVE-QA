{"text": "Runo Stromkirk is the progenitor of the Stromkirk line of vampires and high priest of the cult of an ancient god of the sea and storms on Innistrad . In life, Runo was a high priest who worshipped pre-Avacynian gods of the sea and storms. As a vampire he established his dominion at Drunau in Nephalia and supported master craftsmen and commissioning buildings, towers, and ships, while funding any vampire-friendly efforts by alchemists and magisters. Runo has developed a significant interest in the coastal cults of Nephalia. He has worshipped (protected by his glamer) alongside cultists of the Kralmar and the Gitrog , and thrown sacrifices into the waves for unnamed entities. His spiritual craving wasn't satisfied until he settled down with the cult of Krothuss. Some humans revere him as a prophet. With the onset of eternal night , Runo has decided the time is nigh to summon Krothuss , a legendary kraken said to be more powerful than the Kralmar itself. Associated cards: Quoted or referred to:"}
