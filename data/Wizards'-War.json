{"text": "The Great Wizards' War was Lim-D\u00fbl 's second campaign to dominate Shandalar and was fought against the five wizard schools founded by the Guardian . During the war, the Black Guildlord was killed. Upon Lim-D\u00fbl's defeat, the Guardian removed the necromancer's soul from Azar \u2019s body and imprisoned it within a magical artifact . This allowed the Great Barrier , now powered by Lim-D\u00fbl's soul, to remain intact."}
