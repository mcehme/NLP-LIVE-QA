{"text": "Melira was a sylvok scout outcast destined to be an important figure in the Mirrans fight for Mirrodin against the Phyrexians . She died at the end of New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , succumbing to her injuries to help un- compleat Ajani Goldmane and Nissa Revane . Melira was a wiry human woman with short-cropped red hair and fair skin devoid of metal ornamentation. She was immune to phyresis , and even the glistening oil did not stick to her for long. Because of her immunity, she was the only Mirran to have reached the Seedcore . She had healing powers and worked tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she could. She carries a staff topped with a gleaming light. Known as the \"Fleshling\", due to the lack of metal in her body, since birth, Melira was abandoned in the forests of the Tangle immediately after she was born. She was rescued by Thrun , the last troll, who cared for her. After Mirrodin fell, Melira became a central figure in the Resistance. Her immunity to the glistening oil allowed her, and her followers, to be protected from the effects of phyresis, giving much-needed hope to the survivors. After the transformation of the Tangle , she was captured. Melira was freed by Elspeth Tirel , Koth , and Venser from Tezzeret 's clutches, who said she was his gift to them because she was completely immune to the effects of phyresis. Elspeth grew very close to and protective of Melira. The companions eventually reached the furnace layer and found Ezuri 's rebel camp, where they were welcomed. It was here that Melira's ability to grant immunity to the phyresis was discovered. She healed all those in the camp who were infected by the oil, working non-stop for several days while Elspeth sat with her in the tent. Once everyone in the camp was healed, a council was called in which Ezuri, hoping to become more influential, invited Melira to stay with them while subtly telling her companions to leave. Melira said she would leave with them, however, and Elspeth and the others prepared to travel to the core to try to find Karn . While they were leaving, the camp was attacked by Tezzeret's Phyrexians, and the companions found a guide to take them to the core. They escaped the battle and followed the guide, whom only Elspeth was trusting. During a battle whilst on their way, Koth became angry at the party for ignoring the surface war. He took Melira and left, leaving Venser and Elspeth alone with the guide. Melira was the first creature on Mirrodin to be born without metal parts in her body. Phyrexians captured Elspeth Tirel and Venser, but Koth and Melira reappeared and freed them before sneaking away. By the time the Phyrexians realized that their captives were gone, the party was already running. Venser's strength, however, was wearing thin, and they were forced to stop. He was able to concoct an explosive from the metal on the walls and blow up part of the tunnel, sealing it temporarily, but a group of Phyrexians, led by Glissa Sunseeker , broke through. Tezzeret appeared and his forces battled with Glissa's, allowing the companions to escape and reach Karn's throne room uninterrupted. There, they found Karn being corrupted by the Phyrexian oil , and Melira told them that his heartstone was already corrupted and only a sacrifice could cure him. Venser told the others that he was dying and had been for years and that he was likely unable to last much longer. With his last strength, Venser gave his immunity to Karn, curing the golem at the cost of his life. Cured and lucid once again, Karn asked Koth to begin organizing and leading the resistance with Melira to try to cleanse Mirrodin, no matter how long it would take. Koth and Melira returned to the refugee camp near the Radix in the Furnace Layer. The camp is now called Seedling, named after a story told to Melira by Thrun . At some point Jin-Gitaxias perfected the Glistening oil to be more virulent than it already was, weakening Melira's healing abilities. In coordination with Koth, she received part of the planeswalker strike team ( Tyvar Kell , Kaito Shizuki and Nahiri ) that planned to attack Elesh Norn on Mirrex . She offered to heal any wounds, but the infected Nahiri declined. Together with the planeswalkers she descended to the Dross Pits . Nahiri later dropped them into the Fair Basilica . With the remaining planeswalkers she travelled through the Mycosynth Gardens to the Seedcore and Realmbreaker . After the failed attempt to destroy Realmbreaker and the start of New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Melira was among the last holdouts. She attempted to help Wrenn and Chandra reach Realmbreaker, but the remaining rebels were captured. Elspeth's intervention gave them another attempt to reach it, but Melira was impaled in the stomach by a barbed vine from the compleated planeswalker Nissa Revane in the process. She healed Wrenn enough to help her merge with Realmbreaker before collapsing. At the end of the invasion, Melira was one of fewer than twenty surviving Mirrans able to escape and settle on Zhalfir . With her chest wound infected and her life sapping away, she used the last of her strength to help un-compleat both Ajani Goldmane and Nissa Revane . After the invasion, Melira and the other surviving Mirrans were able to relocate themselves to Zhalfir . New Phyrexia Zhalfir Associated cards: Quoted or referred to:"}
