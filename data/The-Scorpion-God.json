{"text": "The Scorpion God was one of the three gods who were arrested and distorted by Nicol Bolas to serve his interests during the Hour of Revelation . The original functions and appearances and even the names of these gods have been lost. The role of the Scorpion God was to kill the gods . He killed Rhonas , Oketra and Kefnet , but was ultimately killed by Hazoret and a group of survivors led by Samut and Djeru , impaling the monster upon an obelisk. Still alive, the monster began to struggle, but was ultimately brought down by Hazoret as she forgave her lost brother. The Scorpion God is inspired by Serket , the Egyptian goddess of medicine, magic, and healing venomous stings and bites. Associated cards: Depicted in:"}
