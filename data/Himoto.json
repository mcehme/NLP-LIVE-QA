{"text": "Himoto , nicknamed Pompon by its planeswalker companion Kaito Shizuki , is the Kami of the Spark from Kamigawa . Himoto came into being the exact moment that the Emperor of Kamigawa was attacked by a metal-armed man and mysteriously disappeared . She took the form of a tanuki , or raccoon dog, with glowing white eyes and translucent fur. In her natural state, she has multiple golden orbs spinning around her body, and she has a layered voice. She now lives in the mechanized origami tanuki robot that was designed by the Futurist moonfolk prodigy Tameshi . The robot protects her essence and enabled Tameshi to study her. He thought that she embodied the relationship that the emperor shared with Kyodai and the spirit realm, which could have a radical effect on the merge gates . Himoto was instrumental in igniting Kaito Shizuki 's planeswalker's spark after they decided to search for the emperor together. She has become his companion in her robot form and can travel with him across planes. She can also shapeshift her metal hull into a tanuki mask, or in several forms of a drone. The robot form of Himoto has shapeshifting qualities. It can take the form of a tanuki, but also that of a flying drone that can be controlled by Kaito. Sometimes she takes the form of a tanuki mask that Kaito can wear. It is possible that Himoto gave Kaito Shizuki the ability to planeswalk because it carries a broken part of the Wanderer's planeswalker's spark , since it was born the exact moment that the Wanderer's spark was ignited and damaged (and possibly split) by the Reality Chip . Further inference can be made from the fact that Kaito gained his planeswalking powers by attaching Himoto to himself, and that planeswalker sparks can be \"split\" and shared, as shown by Will and Rowan . Kamigawa also has a history of fragments of things becoming kami , as demonstrated by Kyodai . Himoto appears in the teaser, cinematic, and animated trailers for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty . Kami form:"}
