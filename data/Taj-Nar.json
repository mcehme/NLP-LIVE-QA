{"text": "A towering city of gold, Taj-Nar , called the Ancient Den and The First Den , was the city and refuge of the leonin on Mirrodin . It was here that the leonin kha , or king, resided. When the leonin established their dominance over the Razor Fields , Taj-Nar was already the largest den. Located in the center of the Fields, Dakan , the first kha, chose it as the leonin capital. At its base is the Cave of Light , the white lacuna, where legend tells leonin clerics known as abunas focus their faith and cause the white sun to rise every day. Taj-Nar was visited by Glissa Sunseeker of the Tangle , who unwittingly brought Memnarch 's forces to attack the city while searching for her. Glissa left the city soon after the death of Rishan , daughter of the seer Ushanti . The city was later destroyed by a mana bomb, supposedly by the kha, Raksha Golden Cub , himself. However, Vektro , a creature that could inhabit living beings, had stolen the identity of Glissa's sister, Lyese , and was the true culprit in the city's destruction. The Den laid a smoldering crater for years, a symbol of The Vanished Ones and the missing kha. Under the guidance of Kemba the Regent, Taj-Nar was painstakingly rebuilt, but with greater magical defenses. The newly-created Regent's Guard, an elite force of leonin warriors, mages, and skyhunters, now defended the Den at all times. Associated cards: Depicted in: Referred to:"}
