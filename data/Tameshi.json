{"text": "Tameshi was a Moonfolk futurist wizard from Kamigawa . Unlike most other Futurists who think kami magic is outdated compared to more widely available technology, Tameshi always wanted to study how kami could bridge the mortal and spirit realms. Maybe this would offer new insights on the nature of reality. As a teen, Tameshi was a prodigy apprenticed under Katsumasa , a renowned moonfolk scientist, where he manufactured origami drones that could help house new or lost kami. He later built on this design to develop a technology that made it possible for Kami to merge into robot bodies. His purpose was to find a way to protect kami, knowing that the mortal and spirit realms were merging and that one day they would exist as one. In his view, to truly understand the kami, he needed a safe way to study them. He also saw the merging with technology as the way to preserve the kami existing on Kamigawa. He gave one of the drones to his friend, Kaito Shizuki , and Kaito still wears that drone to this day. Once Tameshi had his own lab, he began to study the nature of metaphysics on Kamigawa and developed the Reality Chip , a strange device that can be embedded into the skin and gives the user a mysterious connection to planar physics. After Kaito Shizuki met in Jukai Forest, Tameshi became the young planeswalker's mentor and best friend. The two worked together for nine years before Kaito's sister Eiko warned him that Tameshi was involved in trading illegal merge studies involving kami with the mysterious Tezzeret . When Kaito followed Tameshi to Towashi 's Undercity he found that his friend had also secretly been working with the Phyrexian praetor Jin-Gitaxias . Jin-Gitaxias's purpose was to learn how to compleat a planeswalker without removing their soul. After he had acquired what he needed, Jin-Gitaxias killed Tameshi. Quoted or referred to:"}
