{"text": "Atraxa was a legendary phyrexian angel horror from New Phyrexia . She was called The Grand Unifier by other Phyrexians. Atraxa was a former Mirran angel compleated through the combined efforts of four of New Phyrexia's Praetors . She had pale wings and clawed hands. Her voice was sharp and painful to mortals and even recently-compleated Phyrexians . She carried a spear, and controlled her forces through thought alone. Once a Mirran angel who opposed Phyrexia 's corruption, Atraxa was captured while single-handedly protecting a Mirran retreat. The praetor Elesh Norn honored the angel's tenacity with the blessed gift of Phyrexian compleation and invited other praetors to contribute. While Urabrask declined, Jin-Gitaxias , Sheoldred , and Vorinclex all agreed to join Elesh Norn's efforts, and Atraxa was born, shaped by Norn's own hands, as an awe-inspiring testament to Phyrexia's singular purpose. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse. Atraxa marks the final victory in the Phyrexian conquest of Mirrodin. While Norn focused on tending the Invasion Tree , Atraxa was charged with unifying the plane in her stead. To accomplish this, she would go on to make more Phyrexian Angels in her visage, one of whom was Ixhel . Atraxa was sent by Elesh Norn to lead the efforts of the Machine Legion against the Capennans , in hopes that her history as an angel would lend her protection against Halo 's effect on Phyrexians, while simultaneously striking a blow against Elspeth Tirel . She was commanded to salvage the ship of the Old Phyrexians, scavenge any remaining Phyrexians for parts, kill all citizens, and destroy the Halo wellspring. Atraxa corrupted the Maestros , the family most invested in the history of Capenna, to find the Phyrexian relics. In the process, her mind was influenced by their obsession with beauty, driving her to a destructive rampage against the sculptures and paintings the Maestros' museums held. The bound angelic forms that littered the city also angered Atraxa, compelling her to destroy the statues, releasing the angelic energy stored within. Later, after the invasion was well underway, agents of the remaining families would coordinate a counterattack, using explosives to drop the entire neighborhood of Park Heights on Atraxa. She was later found in the rubble, a steel girder impaling her through the chest, killing her. During the New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse , Atraxa and other Phyrexians could travel across the planes via Realmbreaker .
